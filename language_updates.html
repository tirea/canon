Forget the new vocabulary, so many grammar questions are cleared up as well.<br /><br />I mean I haven't had time to analyze everything, but already the first sentence tells us that we can have two datives together if they are both being the recipients.<br /><br />However it also says that sì is NOT strictly an adposition...<br /><br />Ayeylan[i]ur[/i] oe[u]yä[/u] [u]sì[/u] eylan[u]ur[/u] lì'fya[u]yä[/u] leNa'vi nìwotx<br /><br />Every single noun there has a case ending, in addition to sì being there. &nbsp;That wouldn't work if you tried doing the same with an adposition like mì (Ignoring the nonsensicalness of the resulting sentence if it did work).

No, I think he means tìyawn is already a noun, and can't be broken down further.

I wonder why he didn't just say love is a noun not a verb, if that's what he meant. Why &quot;not an action&quot;? I'm not sure I'd call love an action anyway... more of a state/feeling really... in SFL love would be termed a mental process.

Your only reason for calling it a verb as a unit is that it is a single verb in English.&nbsp; In Na'vi, it's two words taken together.<br /><br />For &quot;I lived&quot; you say &quot;Kelku sami&quot; - the infix goes in &quot;si&quot; because that is the verb.&nbsp; You wouldn't then say &quot;tìkelku si&quot; for &quot;a dwelling&quot;, you would just say &quot;Kelku&quot; because that is the noun which &quot;Kelku si&quot; is based on.

I'll try to answer the questions I can that haven't been covered yet. <br />[quote]<br />awngeyä = our? &nbsp;Why aw?<br />[/quote]<br />Both [i]awnga[/i] and [i]ayoeng[/i] would appear to be contractions of *ayoenga (pronounced &quot;aywenga&quot;). However, [i]awnga[/i] tends to be shorter when inflected for case. WP now mentions that. <br /><br />[quote]<br />Shouldn't yawn be a verb? <br />[/quote]<br />Per Frommer, the noun [i]tìyawn[/i] derives from [i]yawne[/i] &quot;beloved&quot;. The [i]e[/i] drops, as it often does, though we don't know why, or where. I imagine that [i]oe ngaru tìyawn si[/i] (or worse, [i]oel ngati tìyawn si[/i]) would mean something like, &quot;hey baby, come over here and I'll [i]love[/i] you.&quot; If it's idiomatic to say it at all, which is dubious. Prrton and I both suspect that &quot;I love you&quot; might be worded [i]nga oeru yawne leiu[/i] &quot;you are beloved to/of me&quot;. <br /><br />[quote]<br />Derived *kangkem, the verb. <br />[/quote]<br />[i]Kangkem[/i] would appear to be correct. Or at least I think so. Frommer says it's derived from [i]kan[/i] [sic] &quot;to aim&quot; and [i]kem[/i].<br /><br />[quote]<br />Whoop, sorry, not future... &quot;He has heard,&quot; the hearing is over and done with, thus perfective.<br />[/quote]<br />We can have perfectives in the future, if the action is complete in the future. Tense is irrelevant for aspect. (Well, theoretically. As just noted above, they're inseparable in English.)

Another typo, in the sentence [b]Sìlpey oe, layu oeru ye'rìn sìltsan a fmawn a tsun oe ayngaru tivìng.[/b]&nbsp; In the text with the flash of the sound+text, the attributive particle is attached to [b]sìltsan[/b], as expected for an attributive adjective.&nbsp; Here it's written separately for some reason.

I imagine that [i]oe ngaru tìyawn si[/i] (or worse, [i]oel ngati tìyawn si[/i]) would mean something like, &quot;hey baby, come over here and I'll [i]love[/i] you.&quot; If it's idiomatic to say it at all, which is dubious.

I've been taking the literal interpretation of &quot;before the first vowel in the penultimate syllable&quot; myself as well.&nbsp; It does seem a bit odd saying ivomum or ayomum, but I don't see any ambiguity in the meaning by having the infix dangling off the front, even when the infix is the same as the plural prefix.

The English construct of verb+preposition would be a phrasal verb for sure, but wouldn't the Na'vi (And Japanese) construct be considered a &quot;compound verb&quot; instead?&nbsp; (Phrasal verb = verb + preposition or verb + adverb, compound verb = verb + noun or verb + verb)<br /><br />Both &quot;si&quot; and &quot;tìng&quot; get many uses in forming compound verbs in Na'vi.&nbsp; Most are noun on verb, but we get some hot verb on verb action as well with yomtìng.

I think [i]a[/i] in sentences like [i]tì'eyngit oel tolel a krr[/i], is used in much the same way as [i]de[/i] in chinese.<br /><br />The same sentence in chinese (in pinyin without tones):<br /><br />Wo shoudao huida de shihou...<br /><br />Where <br />[i]wo[/i] = [i]I[/i] = [i]oel[/i]<br />[i]shoudao[/i] = [i]receive[/i] = [i]tolel[/i]<br />[i]huida[/i] = [i]answer[/i] = [i]tì'eyngit[/i]<br />[i]de[/i] = relative particle connecting two sentences, indicating there's a relation between them = [i]a[/i]<br />[i]shihou[/i] = [i]time[/i] = [i]krr[/i]<br /><br />Except word order and cases, the two sentences are equivalent.<br /><br />Literally = The time (that) I receive the answer.

I was just trying to reassure that he's aware of this and it's intentional. It would seem that it's being used as an adverb. Consider English &quot;today&quot;, which can be both a noun (today is a beautiful day) and an adverb (I think I'll go today). Maybe he had s.t. like this in mind. Or maybe it's ellipsis of some sort -- won't really know until he has more time.

I was thinking about &quot;work&quot; some more...<br /><br />Frommer says &quot;kan&quot; is &quot;aim,&quot; which probably becomes &quot;kang&quot; because of the following /k/.&nbsp; The &quot;kem,&quot; I think, is the same morpheme we see in, e.g., &quot;fìkem, tsakem,&quot; etc., where it refers to a manner or action.&nbsp; So<br /><br />tìkangkem si<br /><br />would be, literally, &quot;do like aiming,&quot; &quot;do in a way like aiming,&quot; which, if you're a hunter, is probably a bit like a writer using &quot;put pen to paper&quot; to refer to work...

Srane, that is exactly what I meant by it.&nbsp; The pronoun can not be possessed (My father's me?&nbsp; Me of my father?&nbsp; Doesn't make sense) so you start at the pronoun and work out.&nbsp; I'd imagine once you start throwing in multiple genitives like that you'd need a pronoun somewhere in there for that reason, even if that's just a fì'u (Or other fì, tsa, fay, etc word)

[quote author=suomichris link=topic=2623.msg48402#msg48402 date=1264103831]<br />I think this is actually:<br /><br />[b]Ay-lì'ufa awnge-yä 'eylan-ä a'ewan...[/b]<br />PL-word(?) our-GEN friend-GEN young<br /><br />So we get:<br /><br />[b][Aylì'ufa [awngeyä ['eylanä a'ewan]]...[/b]<br />lit., &quot;word of the young friend of ours...&quot;<br />[/quote]<br /><br />That's very poetic but if one has to read that much transformation into such a simple phrase to you're looking at an IMPOSSIBLE amount of mental processing if you're hoping to ever achieve fluent speach. I wasn't questioning the correctness or translation of the phrase by any means, I was bringing up for discussion the subject of the affect that placing the possessor after the possessed does on the sentence.<br /><br />It looks like you're implying that constructing the relationship [b]ikran oeyä[/b] states [i]the ikran of mine[/i]. The inverse of this is would be [b]oeyä ikran[/b] means [i]my ikran[/i]. This works fine conceptually, and in most sentences this works and the relationship is understood and the free word order concept is preserved.<br /><br />You've applied this defenition to the sentence [b]Aylì'ufa awngeyä 'eylanä a'ewan...[/b] to create [i]The words (by means) of the young friend of ours[/i]. This sounds fine written out EXCEPT, how in this case is the presence of &quot;-ä&quot; on [i]friend[/i] supposed to tie to [b]Ayli'ufa[/b]? If we take the claim it does infact refrence whose [i]words are the means of[/i], this implies it is refrencing [b]Ayli'ufa[/b] even though [b]awngeyä[/b] sits between them. If this is attributed to free word order, then what is stopping the sentence from being read [i]The words (by means) of we of the young friend?[/i] which hardly makes sense at all. If it is assumed that the listener in this case would understand because only one construction makes sense ([i]The words (by means) of the young friend of ours[/i]) then we are again full circle back around again to the issue that we are requiring the listener to sift thru and process and so many options that it would make normal conversation impossible. <br /><br />That's why I stated that looked like a &quot;chain&quot;of possession was occuring and that this chain's presence on the right side of [b]Ayli'ufa[/b] indicated that the noun with the possession was not bound to a specific side of the word it possesses (which fits with the [b]ikran oeyä[/b] and [b]oeyä ikran[/b] idea); BUT, under an instance of &quot;chained&quot; possession (aka [i]my bow's string's length[/i]) that it is probably necessary to have them in specific order.<br /><br />to me, it seams:<br />[b]Aylì'ufa awngeyä 'eylanä a'ewan...[/b] could be just as equally written [b]awngeyä 'eylanä a'ewan Aylì'ufa...[/b].<br /><br />hope that helps clarify what I am &nbsp;trying to say. I'm NOT saying the sentence is wrong, I am saying however that I don't think we should fall prey to classic &quot;20-20 hindesight&quot; factor of having a translation provided. Provided translations tend to make people gloss over otherwise confusing issues that haven't been explained. If I have tried to write the sentence &quot;In the words of our friend Hunter...&quot; BEFORE you read it in Frommer's email, what would you have said?<br /><br /><br />EDIT: fixed some spelling/grammar mistakes.

Most likely it's a contraction of some sort, and maybe there's an [i]aynga[/i] in there or s.t.<br />awnga-r: [i]awnga[/i] and [i]ayoeng[/i] (&quot;ayweng&quot;) are both contractions of *ayoenga. [i]Awnga[/i] is a syllable shorter when inflectional endings are added. <br />'eylan sì karyu = 'eylan karyu-sì: &quot;friend and teacher&quot;: like the adpositions, the 'and' can go before or after the noun.

<h4>Harìghawnu</h4>
Here is my transcript. There are some (minor) differences to the one Mirri made, e. g. the genitive of pronouns is not just -yä, but always -eyä; furthermore as confirmed by Frommer, yawn is NOT the verb &quot;to love&quot;, and tìkangkem cannot be broken down to *kangkem as the verb &quot;work&quot;. There are some more little differences, so if you want to, please have a look.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Ayeylanur oeyä sì eylanur lì'fyayä leNa'vi nìwotx:<br />[i]Ay-eylan-ur&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o-eyä&nbsp;  sì&nbsp; &nbsp;  Ø-eylanur&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lì'fya-yä&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  leNa'vi&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nì-wotx:[/i]<br />PL-friend-DAT&nbsp;  1-GEN&nbsp; and&nbsp; PL-friend-DAT&nbsp;  language-GEN&nbsp;  ADJ-Na’vi&nbsp; &nbsp; ADV-all<br /><br />Oel ayngati kameie, ma oeyä eylan, ulte ayngaru seiyi irayo. <br />[i]Oe-l&nbsp; &nbsp;  ay-nga-ti&nbsp; &nbsp; kam&lt;ei&gt;e,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ma&nbsp; &nbsp; o-eyä&nbsp;  Ø-eylan,&nbsp;  ulte&nbsp;  ay-nga-ru&nbsp;  s&lt;eiy&gt;i=irayo.

So in that case it's only adding a -yä.&nbsp; It changes the nga to nge when it attaches, but that should be marked a sound change rather than the cut off of the pronoun.[/quote]<br /><br />Well, maybe. But this sound-change appears regulary in all pronouns and only in pronouns.<br /><br />So we get: oeyä, ngeyä, peyä.<br /><br />In oeyä it could be just oe+yä.<br />In ngeyä it would change an &quot;a&quot; to &quot;e&quot;: nga + yä &gt; ngeyä.<br />In peyä it would change an &quot;o&quot; to &quot;e&quot;: po + yä &gt; peyä.<br /><br />So this are different sounds all changed to &quot;e&quot; ... thus I think, -eyä could be seen also as genitive suffix used in pronouns rather than -yä as genitive suffix causing in pronouns (and only there!) the changing of every preceding sound to &quot;e&quot;.<br /><br />[quote]I think the point is that you cannot have oeeyä, so the duplicate e merges into a single one.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Yes, seems ok to me.

I understand, that the abbreviations might be a problem.<br />Unfortunately there is no universal standard with these abbreviations used everywhere the same way.<br />I'll give you a list of all abbreviations I used (they are generally accepted in German linguistics, most of them are also used international, also by the English Wikipedia article about Na'vi, e. g. the APPROB is also found there).<br />Besides: These abbreviation are mostly derived from the English names of the grammatical phenomens, but nevertheless they are used by us Germans too.<br /><br />Here are all of them (in alphabetical order):<br /><br />1 = 1st person<br />2 = 2nd person<br />3 = 3nd person<br />ACC = accusative case<br />ADJ = adjectivation<br />ADV = adverbial<br />APPROB = approbative = positive attitude<br />ATTR = attributive<br />DAT = dative case<br />DIST = distant demonstrative<br />ERG = ergative case<br />EXIST = existence indicating verb<br />FUT = future tense<br />GEN = genitive case<br />IPFV = imperfective aspect<br />INCL = inclusive<br />IUSS = iussive (demand)<br />NEG = negation<br />NMLZ = nominalized<br />NP = nomen proprium (name of person, town, ...)<br />OPT = optative (wish)<br />PEJ = pejorative = negative attitude<br />PFV = perfective aspect<br />PL = plural<br />PROX = proximate demonstrative<br />PST = past tense<br />SUBJ = subjunctive<br />TOP = topic<br />VOC = vocative <br /><br />@Is.<br />[quote]Seems like a valid point to me.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />It isn't. Please, read Frommer's language log article!<br />Besides: The glottal stop isn't silent.<br />

<h4>Harìghawnu</h4>
No, it's not silent. It's a (voiceless) sound. You can produce the glottal stop without emitting vocals and it is hearable. In German this sound is called &quot;Knacklaut&quot; (crackle-sound?). Of course the glottal stop affects the sound of a word with a following vocal, but it's also a sound by itself and - as said - you can try to produce a sequence of just this sound (without any vocals around it) and you can very well hear the crackling, which is produced by the air, when it is released after the glottis opens again.

That seems like it's splitting hairs...&nbsp; I wouldn't consider that puff of air part of the glottal stop (Of course I'm also not a linguist) but rather an unvoiced vowel stand-in.<br /><br />However it might be useful as a learning aid to teach people about glottal stops at the beginning of words.

<h4>Harìghawnu</h4>
Sorry, I don't want to split hairs. And maybe, I wasn't clear enough. The sound you hear is NOT the puff of the air, but is produced by the glottis strings, when they get &quot;vibrations&quot; from the pressured air. The sound is produced by the vibrating glottis strings, not by the air itself. It's not a &quot;puff&quot;-sound, it's a &quot;crackle&quot;-sound.

It doesn't help matters that a native speaker of English may well pronounce a glottal stop at the beginning of a word with an initial vowel.&nbsp; If such a person tries to say [b]eveng[/b], they may actually be producing [b]'eveng[/b] without realizing it, because that isn't a contrastive feature in English.&nbsp; And it's likewise difficult to distinguish between hearing the two.

<h4>Taronyu</h4>
I asked Frommer some questions. And he responded. Here they are:<br /><br />§ § § § § § § § § §<br /><br />[b]Kaltxì nìmun, ma Taronyu[/b].<br /><br />See below for some answers.<br /><br />[quote=Taronyu]In your Language Log, you show in the trapezium that [a] is the low back vowel, in contrast to [æ]. Did you mean to say [ɑ]? I am aware that you use an old American system.[/quote]<br /><br />I meant [a], a low central vowel; essentially the corresponding vowel in Spanish and Italian, or in the standard American pronunciation of 'hot.' So you're right: phonetically it's not really back.<br /><br />[quote=Taronyu]Is transitivity lexically marked: you've shown that 'promise' is ditransitive in the guide, but what about the other words? Will you be showing us how to do this soon?[/quote]<br /><br />Well, I've been pretty much leaving it up to the semantics to determine what's transitive and what's not, when it's clear. &quot;Sleep&quot; is clearly intransitive, for example; &quot;kill&quot; is clearly transitive. So I don't need to annotate those in the lexicon. For verbs like 'begin,' however, you have to be told which one you're talking about. So for those, I've indicated the type in the complete glossary. Until that's published, let me know what's not obvious and I'll get back to you.<br /><br />[quote=Taronyu]I've noticed in a shot of a script that you stress monosyllabic words when they have an inflection (and therefore are polysyllabic), but not otherwise. Should all monosyllabic words be stressed normally?[/quote]<br /><br />Yes indeed. I underlined the stressed syllables in polysyllabic words for the actors, so they could pronounce their lines correctly. I've done that in the glossary too for all polysyllabic words.<br /><br />The rule for inflected verbs is that whatever vowel is stressed in the root keeps its stress in the inflected form. So for example, the root for hunt, as you know, is [b]taron[/b], stress on the first syllable. So all the inflected forms retain stress on the original a of the root: [b]tivaron, tolaron[/b], [b]tayarängon[/b], etc. Cf. [b]pängkxo[/b] &quot;chat, converse,&quot; where the stress on the ultima. The stress stays there in the inflected forms: [b]pivängkxo, polängkxo, payängkxängo[/b].<br /><br />[quote=Taronyu]If a verb is understood to be transitive (depending on your answer above), when the direct object is replaced by a verb phrase, is the subject still marked as ergative? Essentially, which is more correct: [b]Oe new pivlltxe[/b] or [b]Oel new pivlltxe[/b]?[/quote]<br /><br />Good question.<br /><br />First note that for &quot;can&quot; and &quot;must,&quot; the subject is considered intransitive:<br /><br />[b]Oe tsun kivä[/b]. 'I can go.' (NOT *[b]Oel tsun kivä[/b].)<br />[b]Oe zene kivä[/b]. 'I must go.' (NOT *[b]Oel zene kivä[/b].)<br /><br />&quot;Want&quot; MAY follow the same pattern:<br /><br />[b]Oe new kivä.[/b] (That is, it patterns like a modal.)<br /><br />But since want, unlike can and must, is a transitive verb, there's an alternate pattern:<br /><br />[b]Oel new futa (= fì'ut a) kivä.[/b]<br /><br />And you also have sentences like:<br /><br />[b]Oel new futa Taronyu kivä[/b]. &quot;I want Taronyu to go.&quot;<br /><br />So in the sentences you asked about, [b]Oe new pivlltxe[/b] is fine. In one with [b]oel[/b], though, insert [b]futa[/b].<br /><br />[quote=Taronyu]Is[b] sänume[/b] indicative of a [b]sä[/b]- nomilinalizer to show the instrument of the verb?[/quote]<br /><br />The [b]sä[/b]- prefix is a bit of a loose end. So far I only have one example of it in the lexicon: [b]nume[/b] &quot;learn&quot; vs. [b]sänume [/b]&quot;teaching, instruction.&quot; You're right: I was thinking of it as something like an instrumental affix: instruction is the thing BY MEANS OF WHICH you learn. On that basis, since [b]mun'i[/b] is the verb &quot;cut,&quot; [b]sämun'i[/b] could be a word for a general cutting instrument. I'll need to think more about that, however, since I'm not sure these two cases are comparable. In the second case, you have a concrete instrument, which must be present in order to implement the verb. With [b]nume[/b], though, you can learn by other means than teaching: from experience, from trial and error, etc. So should [b]sänume[/b] refer to any means whatsoever of learning something? I'm not sure yet. Thanks for the question!<br /><br /><br />No problem if you share any of this.<br /><br />BTW, let's take a look at your sentence again:<br /><br />(1) [b]Oel new pivlltxe nìNa'vi mì oeyä letrra tìrey, (2) slä oel tsun pivey (3) trrit a ngat taying (oe new tìying!) ayoe nì'ul aylì'u![/b]<br /><br />(1) and (2) are virtually perfect: just change [b]oel[/b] to [b]oe[/b] in both cases. I like [b]letrr[/b] for daily! I'll add that to the glossary, with RL in the Source column. :-)<br /><br />(3), though, needs a little help. Are you awaiting &quot;the day that you will give us more words?&quot; If so, the verb for &quot;give&quot; is [b]tìng[/b], so it should be:<br /><br />[b]trrit a nga tayìng[/b] (or, hopefully,[b] tìyìng[/b]) [b]ayoer(u) aylì'ut nì'ul[/b].<br /><br />But if I've misinterpreted you, please let me know.<br /><br />Hope that helps!<br /><br />P.S. You know who's awesome? Frommer is awesome. -Taronyu.

<h4>Lance R. Casey</h4>
Great to get something like this [i]nìyey ta meseyri pa'liyä[/i] as Roger so cleverly put it! :)<br /><br />A couple of things stand out to me:<br /><br />Regarding the issue of transitivity, there's another clue sitting right there in the example phrase. [b]Pey[/b] [i]wait[/i] is used intransitively in the letter ([b]nìaynga oe perey nìteng[/b] [i]like you, I too am waiting[/i]), but here it is &quot;made&quot; transitive simply by adding an accusative ([b]oe tsun pivey trrit[/b] [i]I can [u]await[/u] the day[/i]). This is neither a huge revelation nor a surprising one, but it serves to remind us not to be too English-centric, where we sometimes need to modify the verb in some way to get the transitive meaning.<br /><br />Regarding the recent discussion about [b]nì-[/b]modified words I instigated, that same phrase is of some interest. Just by looking at it and comparing with the translation, it might be tempting to posit an adjectival relationship in [b]nì'ul aylì'u[/b] (as [i]more words[/i]), but the lack of an attributive marker is telling. Again the English may be more ambiguous than it seems at first glance, so that a more literal rendering would be &quot;you will give us words to a greater degree&quot;. Thoughts?

I don't think it is either.&nbsp; If he meant that you had to be told by the speaker (By means of case endings), why would he go onto say that for those he has indicated the type in he complete glossary?&nbsp; If it could be used either way at the whim of the speaker, why would he need to indicate anything?<br /><br />Context, context, context.&nbsp; It's as important in understanding meaning as the words.<br /><br />&quot;i begin a new life&quot; - transitive<br />Oe sngä'i (fa/ìlä/ka/mì - not sure which would be appropriate) tìrey a-(adj for new)<br />Intransitive<br />Oe sngä'i r&lt;iv?&gt;ey - I begin living<br />Intransitive<br /><br />same with &quot;end&quot;:<br /><br />&quot;end this, now!&quot; - transitive<br />Ummmm...<br />Fì'u (Verb for end) set! - intransitive<br /><br />Try saying that sentence in English with a subject and see how much sense it makes.&nbsp; It's just the imperative of &quot;This ends&quot;.&nbsp; (But he didn't give &quot;end&quot; as an example there.)

Yeah, I interpret Frommer's email to mean that, for words which are ambitransitive in English, the glossary will need to specify transitivity for the Na'vi verb.&nbsp; See also words like &quot;dance.&quot;

Well ... I do not think, that Frommer wanted to state, that &quot;Na'vi&quot; also can be used as a short form instead of &quot;lì'fya leNa'vi&quot;. Otherwise he wouldn't have used the longer term in his other sentences again and again. I hold, that he simply was touched by the enthusiastic and even creative little phrase of this 11years old guy trying to master Na'vi, so that he chose this particular one to quote it in his message (after remodeling it a bit). I think, it was just a nice phrase to him, and that he surely not wanted to make this a paradigma for the correct usage of words in Na'vi. If he not had just remodeled the phrase, but also expanded it to &quot;lì'fya leNa'vi&quot;, it weren't the words of &quot;our young friend Markus&quot; any longer.<br /><br /><br />

<h2 id="3">Auxilary verb &quot;si&quot;, possessive dative, &amp; &quot;krr&quot;</h2>
<h4>Tiger</h4>
So I finally broke down and did what I was avoiding for a long time, and I emailed Paul Frommer.&nbsp; There were three topics I had questions about, &quot;si&quot;, possessive dative for physical possession, and the usage of &quot;krr&quot;.<br /><br />[b]The auxiliary verb &quot;si&quot;...[/b]<br />The survival guide lists the verb [b]si[/b] as &quot;do, make&quot;, but this sounded to me like it was describing a concept more than a definition, so I asked about this.<br /><br />Si is an auxiliary verb--it needs to be paired with something else. For the verb 'make' you would need something else like txula (build, custruct) or ngop (create).<br /><br />About the only time si stands alone is when the non-verbial element has already been mentioned and is understood from the concept.&nbsp; The example he gave of this was...<br /><br />--Nga tsap'alute soli srak?<br />--Soli.<br /><br />[b]Dative possesive (Copula + dative)[/b]<br />This is indeed how physical possession is expressed, and as suspected Na'vi has no verb &quot;to have&quot;.&nbsp; However contrary to the general principal of flexible word order, the verb usually comes first when used for possession.&nbsp; So for &quot;I have an ikran&quot; it would be &quot;Lu oeru ikran&quot;.&nbsp; He did not clarify why it was only &quot;usually&quot; and not always.<br /><br />[b]Krr &amp; temporial adverb[/b]<br />This is a noun, but it can be used adverbially, as we've seen him do a few times.&nbsp; So &quot;tsakrr&quot; is not just &quot;that time&quot; it can also be (and usually is) &quot;AT that time&quot;.&nbsp; Using a modifying clause with &quot;krr&quot; (linked with &quot;a&quot;) it becomes a &quot;when&quot; clause.&nbsp; For an example he gave:<br /><br />Ngeyä Tireaioang zola'u a krr, law layu ngaru.<br />When your Spirit Animal comes, you will know.<br />At the time that your Spirit Animal has come, it will be clear to you.<br /><br />I also asked about causatives, but apparently it's a bit of an explanation which he didn't have time for, aside from saying there is a causative infix.

Update after thinking: that intersects interestingly with his Language Log statement that there's a &quot;reflexive&quot; infix as well.&nbsp; If he meant &quot;reflexive&quot; more in the sense that reflexives are used in Western European languages (German, most of the Romance languages), then we have a +transitivity and a -transitivity infix pair (for the linguists, yes, yes, I know, valency).&nbsp; What an interesting infix pile-up this will result in.<br /><br />Even with the &quot;free&quot; word order, Frommer has some distinct habits of use.&nbsp; He also seems to really like putting adverbs of degree or quantity [i]after[/i] things, even at the end of clauses.&nbsp; It'll be interesting to get this all sorted out from a discourse perspective.<br /><br />[b]Txula[/b] is new, yes?

Let me convey the essence, however, in a different form.<br /><br />The system, as you know, is octal:<br /><br />'aw, mune, pxey, tsìng, mrr, pukap, kinä, vol<br />volaw, vomun, vopey, vosìng, vomrr, vofu, vohin, mevol<br />mevolaw, mevomun, . . ., pxevol<br />pxevolaw, pxevomun, . . ., tsìvol<br />mrrvol<br />puvol<br />kivol<br />zam ( = 64, or 100 octal)<br />vozam ( = 512, or 1000 octal)<br />zazam ( = 4096, or 10000 octal)<br /><br />First line above: In disyllables, stress is on the 1st.<br />Second line above: In disyllables, stress is on the 2nd, except for mevol.<br />Third line: Stress on the final syllables, except for pxevol.<br />Etc.<br /><br />That should be enough for you to figure out the rest.<br />Kìyevame ulte Eywa ngahu,<br />Pawl<br />[/quote]<br /><br />On a related note: [i]Squeeeee![/i]<br /><br />EDIT: So here we have the full chart (as I see it):<br /><br />[table][tr][td][/td]\	[td]0[/td][td]\	1[/td][td]\	2[/td][td]\	3[/td][td]\	4[/td][td]\	5[/td][td]\	6[/td][td]\	7[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]0[/td]\	[td][/td][td]\	vol[/td][td]\	mevol[/td][td]\	pxevol[/td][td]\	tsìvol[/td][td]\	mrrvol[/td][td]\	puvol[/td][td]\	kivol[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]1[/td]\	[td]’aw [/td][td]\	volaw[/td][td]\	mevolaw[/td][td]\	pxevolaw[/td][td]\	tsìvolaw[/td][td]\	mrrvolaw[/td][td]\	puvolaw[/td][td]\	kivolaw[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]2[/td]\	[td]mune[/td][td]\	vomun[/td][td]\	mevomun[/td][td]\	pxevomun[/td][td]\	tsìvomun[/td][td]\	mrrvomun[/td][td]\	puvomun[/td][td]\	kivomun[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]3[/td]\	[td]pxey[/td][td]\	vopey[/td][td]\	mevopey[/td][td]\	pxevopey[/td][td]\	tsìvopey[/td][td]\	mrrvopey[/td][td]\	puvopey[/td][td]\	kivopey[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]4[/td]\	[td]tsìng[/td][td]\	vosìng[/td][td]\	mevosìng[/td][td]\	pxevosìng[/td][td]\	tsìvosìng[/td][td]\	mrrvosìng[/td][td]\	puvosìng[/td][td]\	kivosìng[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]5[/td]\	[td]mrr[/td][td]\	vomrr[/td][td]\	mevomrr[/td][td]\	pxevomrr[/td][td]\	tsìvomrr[/td][td]\	mrrvomrr[/td][td]\	puvomrr[/td][td]\	kivomrr[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]6[/td]\	[td]pukap[/td][td]\	vofu[/td][td]\	mevofu[/td][td]\	pxevofu[/td][td]\	tsìvofu[/td][td]\	mrrvofu[/td][td]\	puvofu[/td][td]\	kivofu[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]7[/td]\	[td]kinä[/td][td]\	vohin[/td][td]\	mevohin[/td][td]\	pxevohin[/td][td]\	tsìvohin[/td][td]\	mrrvohin[/td][td]\	puvohin[/td][td]\	kivohin[/td][/tr][/table]<br /><br />[table]<br />[tr][td][/td]\	[td]x1[/td][td]\	combining[/td][td]\	x8[/td][td]\	x64[/td][td]\	x512[/td][td]\	x4096[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]1[/td]\	[td]’aw [/td][td]\	-aw[/td][td]\	vol[/td][td]\	zam[/td][td]\	vozam[/td][td]\	zazam[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]2[/td]\	[td]mune[/td][td]\	-mun[/td][td]\	mevol[/td][td]\	mezam[/td][td]\	mevozam[/td][td]\	mezazam[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]3[/td]\	[td]pxey[/td][td]\	-pey[/td][td]\	pxevol[/td][td]\	pxezam[/td][td]\	pxevozam[/td][td]\	pxezazam[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]4[/td]\	[td]tsìng[/td][td]\	-sìng[/td][td]\	tsìvol[/td][td]\	tsìzam[/td][td]\	tsìvozam[/td][td]\	tsìzazam[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]5[/td]\	[td]mrr[/td][td]\	-mrr[/td][td]\	mrrvol[/td][td]\	mrrzam[/td][td]\	mrrvozam[/td][td]\	mrrzazam[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]6[/td]\	[td]pukap[/td][td]\	-fu[/td][td]\	puvol[/td][td]\	puzam[/td][td]\	puvozam[/td][td]\	puzazam[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]7[/td]\	[td]kinä[/td][td]\	-hin[/td][td]\	kivol[/td][td]\	kizam[/td][td]\	kivozam[/td][td]\	kizazam[/td][/tr][/table]<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure how the [i]zam[/i] forms combine to add a number in the ones place.

<h2 id="5">Another email from Frommer</h2>
<h4>suomichris</h4>
Sorry if someone else started a thread for this email already; I didn't see one.&nbsp; This email was actually a response to someone else's question, but it looks like it got CC'd to several folks who had asked similar things.&nbsp; Here 'tis:<br /><br />[quote][i]Ngeyä txantsana tìpawmìri ngaru seiyi oe irayo.[/i]<br /><br />[txantsan = excellent]<br /><br />A number of people have asked about this, so let me explain:<br /><br />There's a small class of &quot;fused&quot; infixes that combine the common -iv- subjunctive/dependent verb infix with those that indicate tense and aspect. It goes like this:<br /><br />PRESENT IMPERFECT SUBJUNCTIVE: -iv- + IMPERFECT -er- --&gt; -irv-<br />PRESENT PERFECT SUBJUNCTIVE: -iv- + PERFECT -ol- --&gt; -ilv-<br />PAST SUBJUNCTIVE: -iv- + PAST PROXIMATE -ìm- or PAST GENERAL -am- --&gt; -imv-<br /><br />I think you can see what's happening here: the CONSONANT of the tense or aspect infix is shoved into the middle of the -iv- infix--an infix in an infix, if you will.<br /><br />With the future subjunctive, there's a slight complication:<br /><br />FUTURE SUBJUNCTIVE: -iv- + FUTURE PROXIMATE -ìy- or FUTURE GENERAL -ay- --&gt; *-iyv-<br /><br />The problem is that although a syllable can end with r, l, or m, it can't end with y (unless it's part of a diphthong, which iy is not). That would violate the phonotactic constraints of Na'vi. So an epenthetic vowel comes to the rescue: -iyev-<br /><br />An alternate form of this fused infix has arisen: -ìyev-. As an instance of vowel harmony (rare in Na'vi), the high front tense vowel i has become lax (ì) under the influence of the lax vowel e in the following syllable. Both -iyve- and -ìyev- are acceptable.<br /><br />So that's a very long-winded explanation of why Kìyevame means: &quot;May (we) See (each other again) in the future.&quot;<br /><br />[i]Sìlpey oe, oeyä tì'eyng law livu ngar![/i]

Note [i]'Awa tìpawmìri[/i] ; evidently numerals require the attributive 'a'. This fits with the film, where Norm says &quot;I studied for five years&quot;; the English is a bit unclear, but in the German dub I hear [i]zìsìt-((o)) a-mrr ft‹ol›ia ohe.[/i] I don't know what that ((o)) is; perhaps an as-yet unknown adposition for &quot;for, during&quot;. <br /><br />Also [i]zusawkrr[/i] &quot;future&quot;, presumably &quot;coming time&quot;. I take it that [i]zusaw[/i] is a contraction of *z&lt;us&gt;a'u. Is &lt;us&gt; the active participle on intransitive verbs, and the passive participle on transitive verbs, maybe?

thats awesome!<br />for easy calculations you can use google: just enter the calculation into the searchform<br /><br />you can write octal numbers by adding 0o in front of the digits<br />eg: 0o114+0o34<br />or usual base10 numbers<br />eg: 76+28<br />or mixed<br />eg: 0o114+28<br /><br />the output numbersystem is given by the first number.<br />so you might want to add either &quot;0o0 +&quot; or &quot;0 +&quot; in front of your operation to transform it what you want

It's a good thing 64x64 (4096) isn't &quot;zamzam&quot;, then I'd be in the middle of a Flintstones moment. But isn't that the sort of thing you'd expect a kid just learning numbers to say? <br /><br />The larger numbers should be at the beginning as per the table. Once you start with sequences like &quot;vol-aw me-vol-aw pxe-vol-aw&quot; doing silly things like swapping orders around makes things more difficult to understand.<br /><br />zampey should be 4096+3&nbsp; &nbsp;  (zampey-mevol does look odd and where would you stress it to make sense?)<br /><br />pxezam should be 3 * 4096&nbsp; (pxezam mevol is easier to understand and you get a cadence with the stressed syllables)<br /><br />This does remind me of Japanese numbering but octal.<br /><br />

The problem is that vofu [i]isn't[/i] one-six, it's eight plus six. If they knew what the largest number the na'vi knew was, they'd know it first as mevol and then it would take them some time to realise it was decimal sixteen.

In octal (and using our numeric glyphs to explain), you'd count this way:<br /><br />0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, ...<br /><br />That is, the tens place is added to for every eight numbers in the ones place. In more mathematical terms, whereas in decimal we multiply each digit by 10 multiple times as the digit gets further to the left, in octal we multiple by 8.<br /><br />332_octal = 3*(8^2) + 3*(8^1) + 2(8^0) = 3*64 + 3*8 + 2 = 210_decimal

In octal you count from 0 to 7 and then you add the 2nd number, as shown above.<br /><br />So, 10 in octal is 8 in decimal and 10 in decimal is 12 in octal. The key thing that confuses a lot of people here is they still represent the same number, it's just written in a different way. 50 people (in decimal) is still 50 people (in octal) it's just written/spoken in a different way. Also the math is still the same (2+2 still = 4, 10x10 still = 100) you just have to remember which system you're working in, octal or decimal.

(Components are often truncated in Na'vi compounds.)<br /><br />sick = spxin<br />disease = sä[u]spxin[/u]<br />the state of being ill = tì[u]spxin[/u]<br /><br />yet, still = mi<br />[A nice minimal pair: mì vs. mi]<br /><br />except = mung[u]wrr[/u] ADP- (that is, an adposition that doesn't trigger lenition)<br /><br />game = u[u]van[/u]<br />to play = uvan si<br />metal (in general) = fngap<br /><br />No words yet for horned, moon, favor, nor, judge/judgment. I'll be thinking about those. (I'm not sure if Pandora even has moons in its sky. Can you have a moon going around a moon?)<br /><br />For &quot;nor,&quot; you may be able to get around it by using &quot;or&quot; (fu) with a negative: to do neither A nor B is not to do A or B.<br /><br />Hope that helps!<br /><br />Feel free to share any of this...[/size][/quote]

Is [i]ke'u[/i] used interchangably with zero? Or is there a more appropriate numeric form?<br /><br />I was, at first, looking at [i]ke'aw[/i], but that looks very... colloqiual. Like you might expect to hear from some distant tribe in a small Hometree.

<br />Frommer says:<br /><br />Nga yawne lu oer. <br />I love you. <br /><br />URL: [url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php?title=Corpus#Lemondrop.com]http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php?title=Corpus#Lemondrop.com[/url]<br /><br />and explains it:<br /><br />[quote]&nbsp; &nbsp; Re &quot;love&quot;: The &quot;indirect&quot; way is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I've been playing around with word orders to come up with the most euphonious version. For me, it's: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Nga yawne lu oer. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Five syllables (sentence stress on YAWN, of course), not too long . . . sounds good, I think. The laudatory infix (as someone has dubbed it) -ie- is possible but not necessary, and I've been omitting it here. &quot;Love&quot; itself is positive enough that it's probably redundant, and all other things being equal, shorter is better. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As for the sentence with tìyawn si, yes, that might mean something different. I'll have to think about it! <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OK, here's a grammatical point I haven't yet talked about explicitly: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Si constructions&quot; have a special syntax. They're considered intransitive--a bit strange, perhaps, but reasonable, I think. That is, &quot;X si&quot; is thought of as &quot;engage in the X-activity,&quot; an intransitive concept. What would normally be considered the object is then in the dative, along the lines of, &quot;engage in the X-activity to/for Y.&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So rather than *Oel ngati tìyawn si,&quot; we have Oe ngaru tìyawn si. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The literal, pidgen-English translation would be something like &quot;I do loving to/for you.&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As I said, I'll to think about the implications of that!

I had come up with [i][b]taluna[/b][/i], from [i][b]ta[/b][/i] + [i][b]lun[/b][/i] (reason) + [i][b]a[/b][/i], in keeping with the idea that the clause following &quot;because&quot; is modifying the head noun [i][b]lun[/b][/i], so that &quot;[i][b]a[/b][/i]&quot; is required. But I can see that over time the final a could drop . . . so I'm happy to parenthesize it in the glossary: [b]talun[/b]([b]a[/b]).<br /><br />There's a related word [i][b]oeyk[/b][/i] (2 syllables, stress on the 2nd) meaning 'cause.' The corresponding conjunction is [b][i]taweyka[/i][/b] (with the obvious small sound changes). And in keeping with the above argument, I'll go with [i][b]taweyk[/b][/i]([i][b]a[/b][/i]).<br /><br />So it's [i][b]talun[/b][/i]([i][b]a[/b][/i]) or [i][b]taweyk[/b][/i]([i][b]a[/b][/i]), which are pretty much synonyms. Take your pick!<br /><br />By the way, a related word is [i][b]tafral[/b][/i], meaning 'therefore, because of that.' (The derivation is probably pretty clear.) It's an adverb, unlike [i][b]talun[/b][/i]([i][b]a[/b][/i]) and [i][b]taweyk[/b][/i]([b]a[/b]), which are conjunctions.<br /><br />Perfect analysis of [i][b]sìlpey[/b][/i], comparing it to [i][b]ralpeng[/b][/i].

Why are we assuming that the numbers between [i]zam[/i] and [i]mezam[/i] are single words? They may well be linked with [i]sì[/i], and even if not, be thought of as more than one word.

In Frommer's Lemondrop interview there is the sentence:<br /><br />Ke lu kawtu a nulnivew oe pohu tireapivängkxo äo Vitrautral. <br />There's nobody I'd rather commune with under the Tree of Souls. <br /><br />Was the contracted &quot;nulnivew&quot; intended by Frommer, or is it a formatting mistake (deleting a space character)?<br /><br />I mean, it is obvious, that this form consists out of &quot;nul&quot; (which seems to be something like a comparative maker, considering the &quot;nulkrr - longer (time)&quot; given in the ASG) and &quot;new&quot; (want). <br /><br />But is it really intended to be one (compounded) word? If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, that would be interesting, because the subjunctive-infix is inserted into the stem of the verbal part of this compound, while &quot;nul&quot; is treated like a prefix. So far I didn't see verbs of this kind in the corpus.<br /><br />&quot;tireapivängkxo&quot; seems to be a related thing.

Yeah, I'm not sure really what the difference is between -yu and -tu, other than -er and -ist in English, which seems to be the best analogy so far.<br /><br />With your [b]spe'etu[/b] example, however, the analogy breaks down. &nbsp;[b]Spe'etu[/b] isn't a &quot;capturist&quot; it's a captive, someone who has been captured.<br /><br />It makes more sense with nouns, since in English that seems to be when the &quot;-ist&quot; suffix is applied (motorist, artist, pianist, violinist). &nbsp;In English one could be an art-ist (noun-ist) and a paint-er (verb-er [probably a bad example, since paint is also a noun xD]).<br /><br />Perhaps when &quot;-tu&quot; is added to a verb, it refers to the person/people commonly linked to such a verb, meaning it would be a somewhat rare occurance, where instead of meaning &quot;One who &lt;verbs&gt;&quot; it means &quot;One who is &lt;verb&gt;ed.&quot; &nbsp;Maybe with a word like [b]tspang[/b] (to kill) you have [b]tspangyu[/b] (killer) and perhaps [b]tspangtu[/b] (homicide victim/kill) i.e.: &quot;Hey, he was my kill!&quot; | &quot;[b]Nang poan oeyä tspangtu lìmu![/b]&quot;<br /><br />Not sure on this... but that's my 2¢.

But the instrumental prefix brings up an interesting question, so to speak...<br /><br />pawm - ask...<br /><br />tìpawm - question?<br />or<br />säpawm - question?<br /><br />Would the abstract concept of asking be a question, or would the instrument of asking be a question?&nbsp; I've seen several people use the former, but I tend to lean towards the latter.

Actually Alim, I'm going to somewhat change my mind on all this -er stuff... since just about every use of -er to refer to someone (who conducts or is interested in) that I can think of has it's root in a word attested in modernish English as both a noun and a verb (or in some cases just a verb).<br /><br />It's just not a helpful language here - we seem to create verb forms for everything. :D Edit: Including to motor.<br /><br />Now that I think about, the irregularites are more towards the use of -ist with more modern terms. But that one is understandable. <br />

I'd like to know about double negatives... &nbsp;Is it required for the subject to agree with the verb in negation, or does that just emphasize the negative? &nbsp;And how does the copula enter into it? &nbsp;Would it be correct to say &quot;Oe ke lu kea 'eveng&quot; or would the kea there be incorrect? &nbsp;Could &quot;Oe lu kea 'eveng&quot; be used rather than &quot;Oe ke lu 'eveng&quot;, or would the former be considered incorrect?<br /><br />(And oddly, I was just thinking about the question of atan this morning.)

Here's a hint...<br /><br />In decimal<br />135<br />1 = 1 (hundreds = 10 x 10)<br />3 = 3 (tens = 10)<br />5 = 5 (ones)<br /><br />In octal<br />135<br />1 = 1 (sixtyfours = (octal)10 x 10 = (decimal) 8 x 8)<br />3 = 3 (eights = (octal)10 = (decimal)8)<br />5 = 5 (ones)<br />= 1 x 64 + 3 x 8 + 5 x 1 = 93 (decimal)

<h2 id="11">The Reflexive and &quot;My name is...&quot; (from a Frommer email!!!!)</h2>
<h4>Tiriuä</h4>
I sent an email to Frommer inquiring about the reflexive infix and he responded! Here's a copy of the email:<br />[quote]Kaltxì ma oeyä 'eylan,<br /><br />Thanks for the questions, Jake. (Good name for someone who likes Avatar!)<br /><br />I guess I haven't mentioned anything about the reflexive yet. Here's a quick explanation:<br /><br />The reflexive is formed with an infix -äp- that's in &quot;pre-first&quot; position--that is, it comes before the familiar infixes in first position.<br /><br />So:<br /><br />I see myself. &nbsp;= Oe tsäpe'a.<br /><br />Note: There's no pronoun &quot;myself&quot;--all you need is the infix. And it's oe, not oel.<br /><br />You've seen yourself. = Nga tsäpole'a.<br /><br />Be careful to keep the stress in the original place. Since for tse'a the stress is on the final a, that's where it stays in all the inflected forms.<br /><br />They'll see themselves. = (Ay)fo tsäpaye'a.<br /><br />wash = yur<br /><br />So:<br /><br />I wash myself. = Oe yäpur.<br />I'm washing myself. = Oe yäperur.<br /><br />Tslolam srak? :-)<br /><br />As for &quot;My name is . . .&quot;<br /><br />You COULD say<br /><br />Tstxo oeyä lu ___.<br /><br />tstxo = name<br /><br />But that's not the idiomatic way to say it. Instead, you say &quot;They call me . . .&quot; (which is of course common in many earth languages as well).<br /><br />The grammar here is tricky:<br /><br />Oeru syaw fko ___.<br /><br />Things to note:<br /><br />syaw 'call' is intransitive: you call TO someone. That's why it's fko, not fkol, and oeru, not oeti. (Fko, as I think you know, means 'one' or 'they' in the general sense.) The actual name as almost like an adverb in this construction: To say &quot;My name is Jake,&quot; you actually say something like, &quot;They call to me in a Jake way.&quot; :-)<br /><br />The question, by the way, is:<br /><br />Fyape fko syaw ngar?<br /><br />Literally: How does one call you?<br /><br />So a typical little conversation is:<br /><br />--Fyape fko syaw ngar?<br />--Oeru syaw fko Neytiri. Ngaru tut?<br />--Oeru syaw Tseyk.<br /><br />In the last sentence, &quot;fko&quot; is understood. You could actually leave it out in the 2nd sentences as well. Ngar and ngaru are used interchangeably--pick the one you think sounds better in its position. And &quot;tut&quot; is a &quot;particle of continuation&quot;--here you'd translate &quot;ngaru tut&quot; as &quot;And how about you?&quot;<br /><br />Hope that helps! Feel free to share . . .<br /><br />Kìyevame.<br /><br />Pawl<br /><br /><br />[/quote]<br /><br />So alot of questions answered! That reflexive infix and how someone would introduce themselves with their name!

Especially if they haven't been counting to large numbers for very long, they might find it uncomfortable to string a bunch of numbers together without any breaks.

Here is what I see so far... &nbsp;I'm leaving a few off here, explanation to follow.<br /><br />[quote][u]General[/u]<br />[s]1. Is this correct: [b]po kä a tseng(ne) ke tsìme'a oel[/b] [i]I didn't see where s/he was going.[/i][/s]([url=http://&quot;http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/combined-answers-1-(feb-16)/&quot;]answered[/url])<br /><br />2. From your examples Na'vi seems to use double negatives as a negative. &nbsp;Is is required that the subject agree with the verb in negativity, or is it merely used as an extra emphasis? &nbsp;How does this work with equative statements (IE I am not your friend - does [b]lu[/b] get the negative, [b]'eylan ngayä[/b], either, or both? &nbsp;Does [b]oe[/b] enter into the negation at all?)<br /><br />3. Are the third person pronouns specifically for animate objects, or can they be used as &quot;it&quot; to refer to inanimate objects?<br /><br />[s]4. Are multiple vocatives clustered ([b]ma smukan sì smuke[/b]) or not ([b]ma smukan sì ma smuke[/b])?[/s]([url=http://&quot;http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/combined-answers-1-(feb-16)/&quot;]answered[/url])<br /><br />[s]5. Does the vocative always come before the noun and all modifiers including adjectives and genitives, or is it just before the head noun? &nbsp;Is it always a particle or can it ever be used as a suffix/enclitic?[/s]([url=http://&quot;http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/combined-answers-1-(feb-16)/&quot;]answered[/url])<br /><br />6. Can [b]sì[/b] be ommitted ([b]smukan, smuke sì eylan[/b]) or must it always be given ([b]smukan sì smuke sì eylan[/b])?<br /><br />[s]7. In [b]toruk makto[/b] it seems like it should be [b]maktoyu[/b]. &nbsp;Aside from &quot;James Cameron Said So&quot; is there a reason it is not?[/s]([url=http://&quot;http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/combined-answers-1-(feb-16)/&quot;]answered[/url])<br /><br />8. What are the evidential forms?<br /><br />[s]9. How are adjectives that begin or end with &quot;a&quot; such as [b]apxa[/b] dealt with when the attributive is used? &nbsp;Do other vowels need any special treatment with the attributive?[/s]([url=http://&quot;http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/combined-answers-1-(feb-16)/&quot;]answered[/url])<br /><br />10. In general, do any affixes cause the stress in a word to shift, or is the fem. tuté purely due to the contraction of two &quot;e&quot; vowels?<br /><br />11. In English we use the present perfect to indicate experience (among many other things), as in, &quot;I have eaten jellyfish.&quot; &nbsp;Mandarin uses the particle guo (过). &nbsp;What's the correct way to do this in Na'vi?<br /><br />[u]Adpositions[/u]<br />[s]1. Regarding adpositions. &nbsp;When they follow, they are written attached to the word. &nbsp;Can we assume this means they are enclitic, and have no stress accent of their own? &nbsp;Is the accent obliterated in two syllable adpostions, as in [b]eyktanmungwrr[/b]?[/s]([url=http://&quot;http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/combined-answers-1-(feb-16)/&quot;]answered[/url])<br /><br />2. The adposition [b]mì[/b] is &quot;in.&quot; &nbsp;What is &quot;into&quot;? &nbsp;Is there some systematic way to create adpositions of location, destination and source from what we have now? &nbsp;Mìso and neto are maybe hints (although adverbial hints).<br /><br />3. How do we get adverbial adpositions? &nbsp;For example, &quot;I go in.&quot;<br /><br />[u]Vocabulary[/u]<br />[s]1. Does the word [b]atan[/b] mean light as in &quot;adj. luminous&quot;, &quot;adj. not heavy&quot; or &quot;n. illumination&quot;?[/s] ([url=http://&quot;http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/atan-lucet-in-tenebris/&quot;]answered[/url])<br /><br />2.

When all we knew of position 1 / pre-1 was the participle, which we still don't know how to use properly, calling that &quot;position 1&quot; and the TAM markers &quot;position 2&quot; was a way to keep things separated. Now that we can start inflecting verbs on our own with both &quot;pre-1&quot; and TAM, we can create enough examples to illustrate the diff, and pretending there are 3 separate infix positions is IMO no longer required. We can just say that when TAM and non-TAM are both used, non-TAM comes first; when two TAM markers are used, aspect infixes into tense and both infix into mood, and that when two tense markers are used, AFAIK they go in temporal order. That's just a way of juggling multiple infixes in position 1, a problem that does not occur w position 2 because only one infix can occur there at a time.

We know as much about the participle now as we did then though.&nbsp; The only thing we know now that we didn't know then is how subjunctive and tense meld, and what the reflexive infix is.&nbsp; The rest we either had a correct assumption about or still don't know.&nbsp; The participle being pre-first, for example, is based on a statement from Frommer that is unclear at best.

Right, but we KNEW reflexive was pre-first already, we just didn't know what the infix was or how to use it.&nbsp; So reserving a spot JUST for something we didn't even know seems a little silly.&nbsp; The participle MAY be pre-first, but it may also be first.&nbsp; We know the infix, but we don't know the details of it's use, so again reserving a spot for it seems a little silly.

<h4>Doolio</h4>
about vocative, i didn't mean in sense when it is used, but more like where should i put the vocative particle &quot;physicaly&quot; when i have something that affects the noun. in the frommer's example &quot;ma oeyä smukan&quot; we see that the vocative particle doesn't go directly in front of a noun (oeyä ma smukan). i mean, is there a general rule to this, how to cope with multiple adjectives/possessions etc.<br />as for &quot;you use &quot;ma&quot; when you name them by something aside from a personal pronoun.&quot;, i don't know. i mean, when you use personal pronouns, you don't actually address the listener by that pronoun - &quot;i love you&quot; is practically the same as &quot;i love her&quot;, or something. &quot;i love you, john&quot; demands &quot;john&quot; to be in vocative, but not &quot;you&quot; (which is in accusative). i don't know what to think of the actual direct addressing by the pronoun - &quot;hey, you!&quot; for example.

Well, hell, we've been using &quot;tesosiyu&quot; in the RP, does that get left anything? <br /><br />It is structured like tsamsiyu, after all, which was what I based it off of, &quot;one who makes ___&quot; (war, art, weaving, etc).

Doolio, I'm still not seeing how what you're asking about vocatives isn't already exemplified by canon material. &nbsp;&quot;ma&quot; has always come in front of the full noun phrase describing who is being addressed in the written examples we have. &nbsp;And it has always been given when the person being addressed is described. &nbsp;Furthermore it has never been used on pronouns (IE never &quot;ma nga&quot; or &quot;ma fìtute&quot;). &nbsp;The only thing which could be unclear about it is if you need to repeat it for every member of a group of people you are addressing and naming off, and if it can come as a suffix like an adposition as roger asked. &nbsp;It's possible that could be drawing conclusions from something that is just common use and not a rule, but it has been pretty consistent. &nbsp;I guess it wouldn't hurt to summarize those assumptions and ask if it is correct.<br /><br />Tìkawngä mungeyu, nothing wrong with that. &nbsp;Just be sure to let us know if you asked any of the questions here so it can be crossed off.<br /><br />One thing I noticed as I was compiling a list was that it was a long list... &nbsp;I think asking Frommer how he wants such questions (Small groups from multiple people, small groups from one person, or all at once) would be prudent. &nbsp;Having a huge list doesn't really save much time for him over simply just coordinating on not asking the same question, and it carries the additional burden that he may feel like he needs to answer all the questions at once.<br /><br />Edit: Updated the list with additional questions/clarifications.

<h2>Re: Email from Frommer re: Numbers (or: The full number chart!)</h2>
<h4>Panzerfaust</h4>
Just got up the nerd-courage to look at this site yesterday. I skipped over the vocabulary to look at the grammar section, and found some very interesting elements.&nbsp; Conjugating verbs by emotion and including dual and trial pronouns are really intriguing ideas for a language. I was, however, flattened by the wall of linguistic vocabulary in the main articles, so i thought &quot;this is awfully complicated for day one, i'l go learn to count to 10 for laughs. That will be easy, right?&quot;. Sadly i find that the Na'vi use base 8 numbers... fundamentally different to all of human upbringing and thought. Looks like counting to 10 is not going to be so easy. Though of course Na'vi is understandably different from terran languages, i was at first annoyed with the unnecessary complication that having to think in base 8 added. I got to thinking on it, and as i hadn't used a base other than 10 in a long time i started counting on my fingers thinking how to say 10 in Na'vi. I quickly remembered how different bases work and had no problem with it. Then something hit me... when faced with a new number concept i used my FINGERS to figure things out. Humans have 5 fingers on each hand, for 10 in total. We can count to 10 on them, and our entire numerical system is based on 10. The Na'vi, however, have 4 fingers on each hand, allowing them to count only to 8, and oddly enough their entire numerical system is based on 8. I was amazed at how much this made sense... assuredly the most early concept of numbers began with us counting on our fingers, and evolved from there. Only natural then, that we think in 10's, and equally natural that the Na'vi think in 8's. Just how much this now makes sense made me respect the guy that wrote this language alot more, and i am now significantly more interested in understanding (at least some of) it.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant... i have a habit of making massive posts and i found the brutal logic of 8-fingers-8-base really intriguing.<br />I am going to look at the guide to linguistic terms i just found in your &quot;downloads&quot; section. Hopefully this will help me understand the articles over the rest of the language better. I have 5 years of highschool spanish and am hoping that will help me understand this language. Thanks to anyone that read all this, lol!

Frommer says that it is mainly used on parts of speech other than verbs. If it was used on a verb it would mean the same as taron and lead to redundancy which doesn't seem to be liked very much in na'vi (effectual infixes getting dropped and the like) so it could very easily have evolved a seperate form for verbs.<br /><br />The way I'm thinking of it is that -tu means someone who makes ____ for nouns or adjectives but means someone who is _____ for verbs.

[quote author=Tsu'roen link=topic=3439.msg73715#msg73715 date=1265173023]<br />I don't know if the Na'vi have a practical use for it. Do they have a calendar? Do they need one? They do not have agriculture and as far as we know the climate is not changing too much. &nbsp;<br /><br />If they had no &quot;0&quot; we may just assume they adapted the English &quot;zero&quot; -&gt; &quot;sìro&quot; or &quot;tsìro&quot;?<br />[/quote]<br />Or maybe [i]ziro[/i] !<br /><br />The Na'vi could have quite an elaborate calendar. Evidently (per the SG) the seasons are quite dramatic, so they'd have the four seasons, and we know they have a word for &quot;year&quot;. But given that Pandora has gotta be tidally locked to Polyphemus, their day would be equal to their month: Polyphemus would not move in the sky, but would go through its phases daily, being fullest at midnight. If Polyphemus eclipses Rigil (ACA), then there may be cycles of eclipses and non-eclipsing periods. Considering how long an eclipse by Polyphemus would last (a substantial fraction of a day), that might inspire calendars. Then there are the two neighboring moons which create strong tides on Pandora (strong enough for tidal heating of the moon, so much stronger than the effect of Luna on Earth), and there are many seas on Pandora, so there's the timing of the tides as the basis for counting time. And finally there's Kent (ACB), a fraction of a percent of the brightness of Rigil, but bright enough to illuminate the night quite effectively - maybe a thousand times brighter than a full moon on Earth. Half of the year Kent would be in the night sky, and half the year it wouldn't, so those are additional seasons beyond spring-summer-fall-winter. Kent's brightness would vary rather dramatically during its 87-year orbit, which is rather elliptical (e = 0.5), so that provides a handy natural 87-year (Terran year) &quot;century&quot; for the Na'vi. Also, the time Kent illuminates the night sky would cycle through the seasons, so you have that even longer period (&quot;millennium&quot;? &quot;eon&quot;?) between times Kent is at zenith at winter solstice. <br /><br />Yes, lots of natural cycles to base a calendar on rather than just day, month, year.

It should be pxevolaw.<br /><br />Look VERY carefully at the tables, which show octal, and you'll see that 8 &amp; 9 are missing. It is confusing because we're using our decimal digits and it looks like we're skipping some.

Hex is actually easier because a-f are used as numbers and it immediately triggers &quot;this isn't decimal&quot;. Dropping 8 &amp; 9 for octal means that there is no easy way to differentiate. I'd expect to see things like 20o for octal to tell me that it is 2x8 or 16.<br /><br /><br /><br />

We can come up with dozens of questions on how individual words are used. I'm not sure it's the best use of our efforts, or Paul's time, when we have so many questions on the general working of the language. Though words like &quot;spe'etu&quot; are likely to illuminate broader patterns, which case we use with &quot;wait&quot; is not likely to be useful apart from that single word, and so would seem to be a low priority.

I really don't see the problem with [i]-yu[/i] and [i]-tu[/i] when attached to verbs paralleling -er and -ee in English and then [i]-tu[/i] doing something slightly different elsewhere.<br /><br /> &nbsp;[i]spe'eyu[/i] (captor)<br /><br /> &nbsp;[i]spe'etu[/i] (captive)<br /><br /> &nbsp;[i]reltseotu[/i] (visual artist)<br /><br />It doesn't cause a conundrum for me, whether the pattern is regular with all nouns or not. It would be nice if it were, but... We cope with much stranger exceptions in English all the time. The -ist that Keyl was mentioning in Japanese (e.6) is also the written word (Chinese derivational morpheme) for &quot;family&quot; and &quot;house&quot; and is homophonous in modern Japanese with the words for &quot;fire, day, section...&quot; all pronounced &quot;ka&quot; and generally (but not always) occurring at the same &quot;word final&quot; position as [i]-tu[/i] and [i]-yu[/i] in Na'vi. We just need to be careful about deriving and neologizing with word final [i]-tu[/i] with nouns (and verbs for that matter) until we understand it better.

A question that came up in a different thread: how to say &quot;mine&quot;.<br /><br />Perhaps you just say &quot;my&quot;. But that would imply that [i]ean[/i] could mean &quot;the blue one&quot; as well as just &quot;blue&quot;. <br /><br />If it does, then adjectives must be able to take case, and possessive PNs must be able to take a second case [&quot;I saw mine (accusative)&quot; - [i]oeyäti[/i] ??]. We've been assuming that's not possible. What we might have is a dummy noun like [i]'u[/i] that takes the case. So this could be quite an important question.

However, what's absolutely extraordinary, and what I find astonishing, is that I am getting people writing me emails in Na'vi. And this is something I never expected. You know, there is a certain amount of information that's out there, some which the studio put out themselves. And I've explained a few things in various formats to various journalists and so on. <br /><br />So, given that—and also given a book that the studio published, which had a small version of the dictionary in it—there are people who have been working like crazy, trying to master the language, and it's been quite remarkable. Some of them are really good!<br /><br />[i]You sound surprised.[/i]<br /><br />Well, I frankly never thought that there would be that much interest in the language. But there is now a website, which I had nothing to do with.. and the studio had nothing to do with, it was purely created by the fans: to help each other learn the language, which—last time I checked—had something around 58,000 (fifty-eight thousand) posts. And there are sub-forums on that website in, I think, 15 (fifteen) different languages. Really quite amazing.<br /><br />[i]Well, yes and no, because, it it isn't just weirdo people and professors of linguistics who like language.

The number conversion page is very annoying to use actually. Can't you just have a normal text box / submit button instead of an annoying thing that changes your value every time you try to type?&nbsp; &gt;:(

From what we know about the Na'vi people, I would say &quot;yu&quot; is simply honorific and &quot;tu&quot; is a fact.<br /><br />Taronyu: That'is not exactly &quot;one who hunt&quot;, but more a grown person who finished his initiation.<br />And &quot;spe'etu and tseotu are &quot;people who do these things&quot;, being captive or art.<br /><br />Of course it make being an artist somewhat lower than a hunter, which sounds really bad. But I see that more like you can be both. Depending of if you can live within the clan being only an artist, without becoming &quot;Taronyu&quot; or equivalent.

<h2>Re: Art related Vocab</h2>
<h4>Skyinou</h4>
I don't think this goes against what I suggested. Since there are words like &quot;uniltaron&quot; which refers directly to something special needed for becoming &quot;taronyu&quot;.<br />Dr. Frommer did said there is no connection with grammar and culture, but there is no way to create a full language without thinking of the people who use it.<br />There we are more on the &quot;vocabulary&quot; part, which is more connected to the people, than the grammar. In my opinion, he said that to mention Na'vi is a full grown language, not a kind of &quot;love-tree simple-minded way of speaking&quot;.<br />I may be wrong, of course. :P

The reason there's so much tree-hugger hippie crap in the current vocabulary is because Frommer only created words as needed to translate the script.&nbsp; So Frommer developed the language, but the selection of words making up the lexicon is entirely due to Cameron.<br /><br />&nbsp; - Eri<br />

We do have the film to give us some idea. Polyphemus looms larger in the Pandoran sky than Saturn does in Titan, though both planets are of approximately the same size. But Polyphemus is more massive, so from both clues the Pandoran orbit should be shorter than Titans, which is two weeks. (Except that Titan is tidally locked.)

<h4>Tsu roen</h4>
FINALLY! Somebody who sees the bigger picture. <br />Na'vi are a stoneage culture and their need for counting is fairly limited. My guess is that in general 8 (all fingers of both hands) is the highest number used in daily life. Maybe 2 x 8 or 4 x 8 are used once in a while. And maybe if a Na'vi get's all silly (after too much Kava) he might count all the way up to 8 x 8.<br />But most likely anything above 2 x 8 is just &quot;many&quot;

The tense, transitivity, and person marking we expect of verbs are all found on these. The lexical &quot;verbal&quot; meaning is found in what look like maybe adjectives or participles. There are Australian languages which do s.t. similar, if not so extreme: all verbal inflection is on one of a handful of auxiliaries, and the lexical verbal content is uninflected. Maybe midway between Kelen and languages we're more familiar with. (There are claims that these languages have only, say, six verbs, but that seems to be s.t. of a simplification.)

Their resulting language was [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English]Anglo-Saxon[/url], a Germanic language with some [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse]Norse[/url] influences.<br /><br />Then in 1066 came with the Norman invasion [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Norman_language]Anglo-Norman[/url] (a French dialect) and with it some Latin into the mix. <br /><br />To make the mix-up complete the English language was fixed in it's written form during the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift]great vowel shift[/url]. That is the reason that an English vowel is in general pretty variable in it's pronunciation depending in which word it is used. <br />

Frommer has given us the rules for large numbers. 66dec (102oct) is zamun.<br /><br /><br />Or were you refering to the etymological form (in which case you're probably correct).

<h4>wm.annis</h4>
Here's the mail from Karyu Pawl.&nbsp; Evidently, he's been having computer difficulties recently.&nbsp; The underlining below is mine.<br /><br />[quote=&quot;Karyu Pawl&quot;]Thanks for combining your questions. Yes, that helps a lot. Excellent idea. The only downside is that if the questions below are typical, they're often hard and deep, and I may not the answers immediately. But questions on this level help immensely in getting me to see the places where the rules need further development or clarification, or where I left inadvertent gaps.<br /><br />Anyway, let me answer a few of the questions now, and I'll do my best to get to the others without too much further delay. As always, thanks for your patience.<br /><br />BTW, &quot;Ma Karyu Pawl&quot; is fine. :-)<br /><br />BTW2, if I had the Na'vi word for 'elegant,' (it's on my list), I'd apply it to your sentence:<br /><br />&quot;Ngeyä teri faytele a aysänumeri ngar irayo seiyi ayoe nìwotx.&quot;<br /><br />Aylì'u ngeyä lor lu nìngay.<br /><br />P.<br /><br /><br />[quote]1. Is this correct: po kä a tseng(ne) ke tsìme'a oel I didn't see<br />where s/he was going.[/quote]<br /><br />No, it's not. But it raises in interesting question.<br /><br />The error is in the case of &quot;tseng(e).&quot;&nbsp; The structure has to be, &quot;I didn't see the place that s/he was going (to),&quot; so we're essentially dealing with a relative clause. &quot;Place&quot; is in the matrix sentence, so it should be marked as an object. Changing the word order for clarity (which doesn't really affect anything) . . .<br /><br />Oel tsìme'a tsenget/tsengit [depending on whether you like tseng or tsenge for 'place'] a . . .<br /><br />But what's the RC? The place THAT S/HE WAS GOING or the place THAT S/HE WAS GOING TO?<br /><br />If it's the former, we simply have: a po karmä (I like indicating the tense and aspect here, although it's not obligatory.)<br /><br />If it's the latter, then since we can't strand an adposition in Na'vi the way we can in English, the structure is similar to &quot;the place that s/he was going to it.&quot;<br /><br />[u]For inanimate &quot;it&quot; you shouldn't use po but rather tsa: a tsane po karmä.[/u]<br /><br />So the two possible versions of the sentence you want are:<br /><br />(1) Po karmä a tsengit ke tsìme'a oel.<br /><br />(2) Po tsane karmä a tsengit ke tsìme'a oel.<br /><br />(2) is unimpeachable, I think. But I'd accept (1) as well. It's a bit loose but it seems like a natural development, and it has the virtue of brevity.<br /><br /><br /><br />[quote]4. Are multiple vocatives clustered (ma smukan sì smuke) or not (ma smukan sì ma smuke)?[/quote]<br /><br />Clustered. &quot;Ma smukan sì smuke.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />[quote]5. Does the vocative always come before the noun and all modifiers<br />including adjectives and genitives, or is it just before the head<br />noun?&nbsp; Is it always a particle or can it ever be used as a<br />suffix/enclitic?[/quote]<br /><br />It's before the noun and all modifiers, not necessarily immediately before the head:<br /><br />ma oeyä eylan: 'O my friends'<br /><br />It's always before the NP, never a suffix/enclitic.<br /><br /><br />[quote]7. In toruk makto it seems like it should be maktoyu.&nbsp; Aside from<br />&quot;James Cameron Said So&quot; is there a reason it is not?[/quote]<br /><br />So you guys noticed that, huh? :-)<br /><br />JC and I had a bit of a discussion about &quot;Toruk makto.&quot; I pointed out that according to the grammar, it should be maktoyu. And I was told in no uncertain terms that it was going to be &quot;toruk makto,&quot; and I should figure out a way to make it work. The man certainly has the right . . .<br /><br />So it's an exception--one of the iconic phrases in the language that developed unusually, for whatever reasons, and don't follow the normal rules. If we looked hard enough we could probably find parallels in English and in all other languages.<br /><br /><br /><br />[quote]1. Regarding adpositions.&nbsp; When they follow, they are written attached<br />to the word.&nbsp; Can we assume this means they are enclitic, and have no<br />stress accent of their own?&nbsp; Is the accent obliterated in two syllable<br />adpostions, as in eyktanmungwrr?[/quote]<br /><br />Yes, they're enclitic, without their own stress. EYKtanmungwrr is stressed on the first syllable--a bit awkward, perhaps, but not too bad.<br /><br /><br />[quote]9. How are adjectives that begin or end with &quot;a&quot; such as apxa dealt<br />with when the attributive is used?&nbsp; Do other vowels need any special<br />treatment with the attributive?[/quote]<br /><br />In such cases the attributive &quot;a&quot; is swallowed up and disappears:<br /><br />skxawng apxa, apxa skxawng<br /><br />I can't think of any other cases where this happens, although aä and äa seem like rather unstable sequences. Until further notice, though, I think we'll allow them.<br /><br />============<br /><br />That's it for now. More soon, I hope . . .[/quote]

Could a linguist perhaps explain the first answer he gives for us non-linguists?<br /><br />Also, I suppose it more or less makes sense that toruk makto would end up being an exception since it's such a profound icon I could see the -yu being dropped.

AFAIK there is no phonemic distinction between ay.ey and a.yey, so I doubt the morphological distinction is maintained.

Oh, I see what you're getting at.&nbsp; I'm not sure there, but again my guess is that it is still a direct quote, so whatever word the person said is stated exactly whether the ending on the word in your sentence is grammatically correct or not.<br /><br />A possible question for the next batch for Frommer:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; As a follow up to &quot;where,&quot;&nbsp; If you were to say [i]I don't know where to go[/i], would you have to have to literally say &quot;I don't know where I go to&quot; since the [b]a[/b] separates two clauses, or could you do some sort of subjunctive construction?&nbsp; Personally I think [b]Oe ke omum tsengit a kivä[/b] sounds pretty cool.<br /><br />

[b]san [/b]and [b]sìk [/b]are always used for direct quotations. &nbsp;You could quote a sentence, or a single word, but whatever you quote is expressed in exactly the same way that the original speaker expressed it (or would have expressed it, if you're quoting hypothetically).<br /><br />The clearest example we have is in [url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php?title=Canon#Extracts_from_various_emails]an email from Frommer[/url] (scroll down to the Jan 21 email labeled [i]&quot;How about ...

the thing with direct speech is clear, but if you see the the quoted phrase as an object you might think you need to write it that way:<br /><br />Poltxe Eytukan[b]ìl[/b] san[b]it[/b] oe kayä sìk, slä oel pot ke spaw.<br /><br />instead of the original<br /><br />Poltxe Eytukan san oe kayä sìk, slä oel pot ke spaw.<br /><br />i see that frommer didn't do it, but maybe it is needed/usefull to mark the case in other situations.<br />e.g. when there is a dative too, or with other verbs.<br /><br />allthough i think it might sound a bit strange to add an acc. ending to another word than a noun.

Oh, okay.&nbsp; I see your point, but we don't mark noun phrases or verb phrases that are in the place of objects, so I don't think there's any reason to mark a quotation with [b]-it[/b] either.&nbsp; And at any rate, I'm certain it would be wrong to add noun case markers to anything that's not a noun - we've never seen such a thing anywhere in the corpus.<br /><br />But as far as Eytukan vs. Eytukan[b]ìl[/b] - that's an interesting observation; I don't think anyone's pointed that out before.&nbsp; It appears that &quot;X says quote Y unquote&quot; is an [i]intransitive[/i] construction, much like the modal verbs can/must/want.<br /><br />&nbsp; - Eri<br />

Another question: do adpositions ever go with nouns that have a case marker, or will the nouns always be uninflected for case?<br /><br />(I assume adpositions evict any case markers based on what we've seen so far, but Word from On High would be useful.)

I'm not sure if it was from Frommer or Karyu Amawey but someone said that adpositions behave like case markers when used post-positionally in which case it would be impossible.<br /><br />Of course, word from on high would be great.<br /><br /><br />[hr]<br /><br /><br />Ok, it's now been 17 days from when I sent my email and wm.annis got a reply so I think my email probably got lost in a spam folder or something.<br /><br />Because of that I've decided to post my questions here:<br /><br /><br />The number system you have kindly given us implies that the Na’vi have some concept of multiplication and addition (they call 17 two eights and one), so what would they call these operations?<br /><br />Following on from my previous question, do the Na’vi have any words for subtraction and division?<br /><br />As the Na’vi do not seem to have any sort of currency there is unlikely to be any incentive for them to develop a theory of negative numbers to handle debts but they may have developed a concept of fractions, if so, what would they call these?<br /><br />With infixes, in the language log article you described there as being two infix positions and a pre-first position. Is this pre-first position taken by the participial infix &lt;us&gt; as well as the reflexive? Also, might there be more infixes that also take this position and if so (or not), might it be helpful for us to think about it as three infix positions the first of which is rarely used rather than a pre-first position?<br /><br />How does &lt;ol&gt; meld with tense infixes? Is it the same as &lt;er&gt; does for &lt;a&lt;r&gt;m&gt; and &lt;ì&lt;r&gt;m&gt;, also, does &lt;er&gt; continue this pattern for melding with &lt;ìy&gt; and &lt;ay&gt;?<br /><br />If si can only be used as an auxiliary verb, what would be used for any other uses of the verb to do/make (although I can’t think of any right now, I’m sure some have come up on the forum).<br /><br />How do you form passive participles (if you do at all).<br /><br />Can fnu be used as an adjective for quiet?<br /><br />The Na’vi don’t seem to have any form of currency or economy so money would be meaningless to them but do they have any vaguely equivalent term/practice similar to bartering (for the practice) or some form of expense or effort for the noun.<br /><br />Does Na’vi have any words for the following yet: skull, tongue, burial, grave, the frame that Jake and Grace are tied to, the verbs to drown, to talk and to say (or the last two just plltxe?); name, old, footstep, it, foot and Polyphemus.<br /><br />What does the &lt;eng&gt; in oe tsap'alute sengi mean?<br /><br /><br />[hr]<br /><br /><br />There were a few other questions that have subsequently been sorted though.

If this behaves in the way it seems (and is actually the causative infix) then I think the original subject -&gt; indirect (dative) object is good.<br /><br />Personally though, I don't want this to be right. Given it's similarity to the verb [desc=leads][b]eyk [/b][/desc]which would make sense in this context so I'd quite like eyk to be a modal verb creating causative forms.<br /><br />

Pawl has said he hasn't considered the Na'vi culture in creating the language, but perhaps now is a good time for him to start.&nbsp; Could the Na'vi have no words for [i]left[/i] and [i]right[/i]?&nbsp; Might they make a distinction between [i]directions on the ground[/i], [i]directions in the trees[/i], and [i]directions in the air[/i]?&nbsp; If they have cardinal directions, are they tied to Pandora's motion relative to Polyphemus, Alpha Centauri, or the celestial background?&nbsp; Or are they relative to landmarks instead?&nbsp; Could the words for direction also incorporate a concept of distance, similar to the way the five verbal tenses incorporate both direction (past/future) and distance (near/far)?<br /><br />[b][u]Colors:[/u][/b]<br /><br />When it comes to colors, Pawl could transcend not just human language, but human [i][b]biology[/b][/i].&nbsp; The [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_term]variety of color terms[/url] in human languages is simultaneously very diverse (ranging from two to twelve &quot;basic colors&quot;) and very predictable (the sequence of which colors are added when as a language evolves is nearly the same all over).&nbsp; This is probably because of the way the human eye works.<br /><br />Now, based on the evidence of the film, Na'vi color vision is not particularly different from humans', because 1) we see things from Jake's avatar's perspective and things look pretty much the same, and 2) if Jake's avatar-vision were that different from his own, surely he would have mentioned it while on-camera; Cameron would have been sure to point it out to the audience if it were so.&nbsp; But even with that as a constraint: at the very least, the Na'vi (and avatars) are better able to see at night, and to notice the omnipresent bioillumination that makes up their night-time world.&nbsp; Instead of the basic color terms being variations of white/black/red/yellow/green/blue, maybe they see the world as &quot;sunlight/shadow/living-light/darkness/blue-green/red-yellow/brown&quot;.&nbsp; Maybe the Na'vi have a [i]biological[/i] capability to see a color distinction between things that are alive (plants and animals) and inanimate (stone, earth, metal), so that a brown rock and a brown tree trunk have different color words because they [i]actually register as different colors to Na'vi eyes[/i].&nbsp; Maybe there are colors (and color names) that can only be seen through tsaheylu.<br /><br />[hr]<br /><br />Pawl has said Na'vi is made up of things already found in human languages, even though the combination is unique.&nbsp; Well, that was two months ago... he's since gone beyond that with the number system!&nbsp; Now, that may have been a natural, perhaps even obvious, thing to do, but I for one encourage him to keep it up and keep going even further!&nbsp; I don't know how much of this kind of stuff Pawl can do on his own versus needing Jim Cameron's input.&nbsp; I don't even know how interested he is in pushing things that far.&nbsp; But I can hope.&nbsp; And wait.&nbsp; And see.<br /><br />&nbsp; - Eri<br />

It seems to me that &quot;fwa&quot; at the start of a sentence is a shortening of &quot;This is X&quot;... which if translated directly would come out as &quot;Fì'u lu fwa X&quot; or just &quot;Lu fwa X&quot; both of which contain superfluous words.&nbsp; So that one makes perfect sense to me.<br /><br />To use = big win though, I've been wanting that verb for awhile.

I consider myself a pretty sophisticated language learner, but Irish knocked me for a loop. (And they say English spelling is hard!) I found the mutations—if I remember correctly, eclipsis and lenition—very interesting. And lenition wound up influencing Na’vi. I had also studied Hebrew, where there’s a process of “spirantization” that has something of the same effect although in different environments, so that was an influence as well.<br /><br />“The final influence was Malay/Indonesian, where certain prefixes mutate the initial consonant of the root. It always tickled me that in a Malay dictionary, you need to look up the word “menarik” under T, the word “memandang” under P, and the word “menyatukan” under S! And that situation, of course, has a parallel in Na’vi, with the “short plurals.” (You look up “hilvan” under K, “sute” under T, “fizayu” under P, etc.)<br /><br />Pawl<br />[/quote]

I had a feeling that would be the case in the copulative lu...&nbsp; I couldn't think of an example that actually made sense.&nbsp; Even for other uses, the best I could come up with is &quot;cause to have&quot; - but that is conceptually the same as other verbs such as give.<br /><br />But I was hoping you would have some brilliant answer for slu drawing on some obscure dead language construct, because that seems more useful to be used causatively.&nbsp; I guess we need to wait for Nawma Karyu to give us more information.

<h4>roger</h4>
A question came up, I forget where, of whether [i]zene ke / ke zene[/i] meant &quot;must not&quot; or &quot;don't need to&quot;. Well, we got our answer without asking. (At least, I didn't ask in this email.) Also some new words. <br /><br />[quote author=Frommer]<br />Sìltsan nìtxan. Tìng nari nekll.<br /><br />:[i][That is, &quot;See below&quot;, where he interlaced his answers w my questions, which I'll put in italics. Comments I'm adding now are in brackets.][/i]<br /> <br />[embedded email]<br /><br />:[i]Did I get this right?[/i]<br /><br />:[i]Hém geyä zégke fkóru livú cá(y)hem a gáru pŕrte' ke lú.[/i]<br /><br />:[i][this was the Golden Rule][/i]<br /><br />Very fine. I’ve spelled it zenke, even though it’s pronounced with a velar nasal. And I realize I’ve been inconsistent in doing that, since I’ve spelled lumpe with an m rather than the underlying n. Was probably influenced by English (“impossible,” but “income”). But maybe a little inconsistency isn’t the worst thing in the world.<br /><br />BTW, zenke and ke zene are semantically distinct:<br /><br />Nga zenke kivä! ‘You must not go!’<br /><br />Nga ke zene kivä. ‘It’s not obligatory (OR: it’s not a must) that you go.’<br /><br />And how many people have adopted the “scientific” transcription? It’s nice to see it, although I don’t think it will ever become as popular as the “official” one. (Notice what happens when you write Tsu’tey in scientific. NOT a good association with that character. &lt;g&gt;)<br /><br />:[i]and is zegke short for zene ke ?[/i]<br /><br />:[i]This one seems clear:[/i]<br /><br />:[i]lǐ'fyari leNá'vi Ŕrtamì vay sét 'almóg a frá'u zerá'u ta gŕrpogu[/i]<br /><br />:[i]assuming Rrta for &quot;Earth&quot;; confirms grr &quot;root&quot; and past pfv. I assume future pfv would be 'alyog.[/i]<br /><br />Right. As you now know, it’s ‘Rrta.<br />[/quote]<br />So, he seems to be accepting &lt;aly&gt; for future subjunctive. <br /><br />Unfortunately, I think I should leave out the next bit in English for now; it's not of much interest anyway except for the new vocab:<br /><br />[quote]<br />maw (ADP-) = after (time)<br /><br />hìkrr (stress on 1st) = second, very short time<br /><br />tätxaw (stress in 2nd) = return (intrans.)<br /><br />Maw hìkrr ayoe tìyätxaw.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I've suggested this before, and it now seems that Frommer would like it: Why not switch to the c, g orthography at this intermediate level? His concern is accessibility, which is why he's requested that the Wiktionary appendix be kept with ts, ng, but that's not really an issue at our level, it is? No more difficult that Fijian spelling! <br /><br />The Golden Rule, BTW, is called [i]korén a'awve tìruséyä 'awsitég[/i] &quot;the first rule of living together&quot; (stress shifted on a'awve, so I can't say which is correct). Don't know if it's supposed to be a traditional Na'vi saying or not. <br /><br />Some attributive forms, my transcription: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; snúmìnä skxáwg [at least, I can't hear an 'a' after snúmìnä; it might be there], skxáwg asnúmìnä<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; skxáwg apxá, apxá skxáwg [this is confirmed in writing]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; skxáwg ayáwne, yáwnea skxawg [answers old questions about the nature of 'beloved']<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; pxeskxékeg atxáncan, txáncana pxeskxékeg [pronounced &quot;txansan&quot;]

I can't really see the point of changing - this is not the orthography of Na'vi, so we're not concerned with being faithful to the language - just about representing sounds. Which the current system does fine and we're all used to it.<br /><br />And think of poor Taronyu - having to go through and change that whole dictionary. :D Maybe wait and see what transcription system Dr. Frommer puts into the &quot;glossary&quot; when it's published, before we make a call on this one.

A full evidential system would be extremely difficult for an English speaker to master, because not only would you have to report [i]with every clause[/i] what your source of knowledge was, but if you were talking about other people, you'd have to keep track of what their source of knowledge was for every clause too! That's why the Chinese have such difficulty we he / she: it's not the concept, which is easy enough, but training oneself to keep track of something that one grew up ignoring. (Though it doesn't help that they are homonyms with a Mandarin accent!) <br /><br />We effectively have two evidentials here. Remember, there is no indirect speech in Na'vi. So in effect 'san ... sìk' function as a hearsay/reported-speech evidential. &lt;ats&gt; could then be the inferential evidential. If grammatically required in some constructions, it could be quite interesting.

I actually think Dr. Frommer will at least give us one more to indicate there is evidence to support what the speaker is saying. No basis for saying that other than gut feeling. :D

Simple: the adposition for &quot;on (top of).&quot; For one of the Na'vi quotes in my sig, I was forced to use the word, [i]mì[/i].

Like, he doesn't have to give us the specifics, but perhaps he can tell us whether or not he's yet come up with words for a large range of...colors, let's say. At least, give us confidence that if and when the flood gates open, we could expect Noah's flood behind it.

Na'vi is not the property of Fox. Or of Cameron. Or of Frommer, for that matter. You can't own a language, at least not under US copyright and patent law. They could trademark the name &quot;Na'vi&quot;, though they haven't. But Frommer does need to work with Fox, and that's as important as legal ownership. We accord Frommer de facto ownership of Na'vi because we respect him and trust he'll do a better job with it than we would, and to keep the project from splintering.

Karyu Pawl poltxe:<br /><br />[quote]BTW, subject pronoun pro-drop is good Na'vi style. The rule I've been assuming is that once you establish the identity of the subject, you can drop subsequent subject pronouns until the subject changes, at which point you cycle back to Start. People seem to be doing that fairly aggressively in English, in IMs and texting if not in actual spoken conversation. (&quot;Saw you online and wanted to say hi. Hope everything is fine.

Starting a bit more than a week ago Frommer has been copying his email replies to people's Na'vi questions to a few people.&nbsp; The main Wikipedia article editor gets a copy, I get a copy, Prrton sometimes gets a copy and sometimes a few other people do (many from this forum).<br /><br />When I get these I dump them into the LearnNavi.org wiki (assuming someone else hasn't already done so).&nbsp; We've reached a point where I'm going to stop dropping all of Frommer's email into the Canon page in one particular situation — vocabulary lists.&nbsp; It seems awfully silly to cut-n-paste new words onto one page of the wiki, only to create a dictionary entry on a different page of the same wiki.&nbsp; Anything I get about grammar, or special elaborations about a particular word usage, will still be treated in the usual way.<br /><br />I realize this presents a bit of a sourcing problem, but we'll have cross-validation for all new vocab.&nbsp; Tarnoyu and the main editor of the Wikipedia (who works on the Wiktionary [url=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Na'vi]Na'vi Appendix[/url]) will also be getting copies of vocab-related email.&nbsp; A word in all three places is sound.&nbsp; Note that we're still missing some ASG vocab in the LN.org wiki — we've been more focused on new words and examples there, but we're nearly complete with ASG vocab, too.&nbsp; Note also that not all of us getting email from Frommer edit at the same pace.&nbsp; The Wiktionary already has the data from recent email that I've not gotten to yet.

[quote author=Plumps83 link=topic=4785.msg112328#msg112328 date=1266960285]<br />[size=12pt][font=Garamond]Hmm, I encountered a little translation problem and hope somebody can help me. It's the use of the &lt;eyk&gt; together with a modal verb.<br /><br />So, if I wanted to say: &quot;You can change the text&quot;<br />[b]latem [/b]would have to get the &lt;eyk&gt; infix because in this context it's transitive.<br />What happens with the other components? I'm still confused about which takes the ergative, accusative and (if required) dative markers...<br />Am I assuming that<br />[b]Ngal tsun l&lt;eyk&gt;&lt;iv&gt;atem[/b] *the text*[b]-it[/b] would be correct?<br /><br />Thanks for any help. :)[/font][/size]<br />[/quote]<br /><br />&quot;The text&quot; should be in ACC, nga does not need the ERG&nbsp;as tsun is intransitive while the sub. clause's ngal can be left out, I believe.<br /><br />I think there are basically two ways of using -eyk- and they seem to follow the same formula:<br /><br />1. Intransitive verbs, like latem and sngä'i, become transitive with the causative infix, i.e. [b]Oel sneykä'a tìkangkemit[/b] &quot;I begin the work.&quot; &nbsp;The thing being affected takes the ACC, the agent who caused it is in the ERG.<br /><br />2. Transitive verbs, like taron, one is causing the action to happen but not doing it oneself, i.e. [b]Eytukanìl Neytirir yerikit teykolaron[/b]. &quot;Eytukan made Neytiri hunt a hexaped.&quot; &nbsp;The agent who caused the action takes the ERG, the noun acted on by the verb takes ACC as in the non-causitive sentence, and the person caused to do the verb is in the DAT.<br /><br />[THEORIZING] I don't think the specific entity that performed the action need be outright stated. &nbsp;[b]Eytukanìl tspeykolang pot[/b]. &nbsp;&quot;Eytukan had him killed.&quot; It doesn't seem important to say &quot;by someone&quot;, and it follows the same structure as &quot;I had that changed&quot;. &nbsp;I could be wrong though. <br /><br />But how do you say &quot;I made him change that&quot;? &nbsp;maybe: [b]Oel poru leykolatam tsat[/b]. or also (I am more sure about this one): [b]Oel fa po leykolatam tsat[/b]. [/THEORIZING]<br /><br />-Keyl<br /><br />

But I think you could justify either version. Your call...<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />Oeri/oeru is often a toss-up.

If this example seems &quot;backwards&quot; to you compared to the « A [i]to[/i] B » example in the notes, it's probably the semantics of « [i]ke'u[/i] » in this context messing with your head.

You can't use &quot;worst&quot; or &quot;best&quot; with &quot;than&quot; either. We have other words like that in English. &quot;Unique&quot;, for example. &quot;More unique&quot; is like &quot;All people are equal, but some are more equal than others&quot;. Or &quot;my most favorite&quot;. And F used sìltsan in his example, so I think we can assume that swey isn't intended to be suppletive for the comparative.

Despite &quot;First&quot; in English using a superlative looking ending, it is in fact an ordinal and not a superlative.&nbsp; Superlative implies there is others of a certain class of something, but the superlative is declaring something is the most of that.&nbsp; First isn't the &quot;Most one&quot; because there aren't degrees of being one.

That doesn't really clarify much except to agree that &quot;become&quot; in English is a linking verb (AKA copulative verb) which agrees with the known usage in Na'vi, and my example above, and that still leaves us with the question of how the causative infix applies there.<br /><br />For links, simply click the &quot;insert hyperlink&quot; button, then instead of putting the URL in the middle, change the first &quot;url&quot; it gives you into &quot;url=your/url/here&quot;, then add the text you want to see between the url and /url.

Damn me and my English only knowledge.&nbsp; After beating my head around trying to figure out why nobody else seemed to like my way, it finally occurred to me that it may just have been I was going after how it is said in English would not be how it is said in other languages.&nbsp; (And google search agrees that &quot;learn how to X&quot; is used far more than &quot;learn so that X&quot; in English, with the latter referring to indirect effects of the learning rather than direct effects.)<br /><br />It would be interesting to hear Karyu Pawl's thoughts on this, but IMO it's something relatively unimportant at this point since it's just picking up details of the best way to say something we know rather than how to say something we don't.

Back on topic, another couple....<br /><br />In Avatar, it sounds like Neytiri says &quot;Oel pot tspìmìyang&quot;.&nbsp; Is this a mis-hearing, or is there really two tense infixes given to provide the &quot;had been about to&quot; phrasing?<br /><br />Personal pronouns seem to like -eyä as the genitive suffix, but no other words we've seen get this treatment.&nbsp; It there some general rule we don't know, or is it really as simple as the pronouns get -eyä?&nbsp; If it's the latter, does that extend to gender suffixed, such as poeyä or poaneyä (Or as William suggested, poenyä, which nicely keeps the masculine and feminine versions the same number of syllables)?

Hey, thanks! <br /><br />BTW, he does say that maw does not cause lenition. <br /><br />I'm not surprised by ayoe. I'm more surprised by ruseyä. In ayoe, the &quot;ayo&quot; behaves like VCV, with the y being the onset of a syllable. In ruseyä, the &quot;eyä&quot; behaves like VV, with the y being the coda of a syllable. But AFAIR Frommer said Na'vi does not have this contrast.

You're probably right but it seems like it also brings back elided vowels, as in the oeng-&gt;oengeyä case, so it's more than just a simple vowel movement.

Try a different MP3 player, or turn off surround in the one you are using?&nbsp; MP3 files don't typically define more than two channels (Left and right), and if they are the same, something trying to process it for surround w/ pro logic or whatever will naturally send the result to the center speaker.

How do &quot;si&quot; based verbs work as far as modified parts of speech?&nbsp; I know we have &quot;tsamsiyu&quot; as one example, but is that just a James Cameron thing, or is that a normal construct for doer of si-verb?&nbsp; (And why is it tsamsiyu rather than just tsamtu?)&nbsp; How does the participle enter into this...&nbsp; For example if I wanted to say a &quot;Helping person&quot; or a &quot;Filling meal&quot;, would it be based off the si verb form, or would it just be a modification of the root word...&nbsp; (lesrung / leteya?)<br /><br />(This next two maybe someone here can answer rather than having to pass onto Karyu Pawl...)<br /><br />What is the difference between &quot;hawnu&quot; and &quot;tìhawnu si&quot;?<br /><br />For the name of the Na'vi &quot;Golden rule&quot; it uses tìrusey for the gerund form of live...&nbsp; Obviously tìrey in this sense is life.&nbsp; But at other times you have said to use the tì- nominilization to form a gerund, and gave &quot;Tìtaron lu lehrrap&quot; (hunting is dangerous) as an example.&nbsp; In other cases, the nominilized form is a different meaning as in the rey case, such as 'eyng = v. answer and tì'eyng = n. answer.<br />(Or am I just being English-only speaker dense again, and something like &quot;an answering&quot; and &quot;an answer&quot; are the same thing in other languages?)

Spe'e is also a verb, not a noun, so it's already an exception to what Frommer gave as the usage.<br /><br />And yes, in English the gerund is a noun form of the verb.&nbsp; So yes, that's the difference I meant.&nbsp; I wasn't disagreeing with the usage in life vs living, that would be silly since the words come from Frommer.&nbsp; I was just saying if it has to use &lt;us&gt; for living, why would other words be different and not have to?&nbsp; Not that I'm against a little irregularity in the language - it's like the linguistic equivalent of lense flare - something that in the real world is present with attempts to minimize, but in the CG world is purposely added to create realism.&nbsp; I'd just like to know what is irregular and what is the rules.

We had a possible question a while ago for the next email to Karyu Pawl regarding what happens, pronunciation-wise, when the attributive marker -a- encounters a consonant such that a [desc=Do you pronounce it as &quot;a then consonant,&quot; or as a diphthong]diphthong is created[/desc].&nbsp; Well, listening from 3:10 to 3:12 [b]skxawng ayawne[/b], it appears you pronounce it as a diphthong.&nbsp; So we can scratch that off the list.

We don't know. But hawnu is also glossed &quot;shelter&quot;. So perhaps that is more literally protecting s.o. in the sense of shielding them, whereas tìhawnu si might be more abstract, acting as a protector.

Ayoe is a plural form, I was not trying/meaning to imply pronunciation rules for plurals, only for -a- pertaining to adjectives.

Instead of waiting and analyzing everything he sends us for insight on new words, why don't we try to help him out.

<h2>Re: Frommerian words and our wiki vocabulary.</h2>
<h4>Harìghawnu</h4>
Sorry for awaking this thread again ... I was ill last week and wasn't able to check the forum. What William wrote about not giving vocablists any longer in the canon page but only to put the words into the vocabulary seems rational to me too. Unfortunately this will widely disqualify me from contributing to the vocabulary site any longer, since I'm not on Frommer's &quot;mailing-list&quot; and never got any mail from him. All what I contributed to the vocabulary was taken out of the ASG and - exspecially - out of my scrupulous word-by-word-analysis of the corpus-texts and canon-snippets, to find out the words and morphemes, which didn't exist in the vocabulary yet. Any time I got one, I inserted it into the vocabulary. Since I try to do it very diligently, I'm only at the &quot;MND&quot;-vocab at the moment, but there shoud be no single word or morpheme from the texts and snippets preceding it, which isn't in the dictionary and didn't get it's sourcing ... with exeption of Jake's script (which I didn't include at all at the moment) and some words still to discuss and marked red in my personal analyzing-papers. <br /><br />Well ... since at least our leading Na'viists seem to get Frommer's mails, it's up to you to keep us updated with words, which weren't accessible to the rest of us otherwise. Thank you all for your engagement!<br />

Yes while I see not posting everything on the canon page on the wiki at least post it somewhere.

mj, thanks for the list!&nbsp; This will be helpful to a bunch of people.&nbsp; Lance did [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/intermediate/my-dictionary/msg110244/#msg110244]something similar recently[/url].&nbsp; The two of you may want to cross-check each others' work.<br /><br />Also, you may want to cross-check Wiktionary against the LN Wiki.&nbsp; As it turns out, it's not too hard to find out what got added to each of them recently, since the wikis keep complete revision histories.&nbsp; I think I've found the points in time at which William started adding undocumented words to the LN Wiki (22:58, 22 February 2010) and Kwami started adding undocumented words to Wiktionary (20:37, 21 February 2010).&nbsp; So the following links will show you all the changes since then, which will (I'm assuming) include all the new words:<br /><br />[url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php?title=Vocabulary&amp;diff=1521&amp;oldid=1413]Diff for Learn Na'vi Wiki Vocabulary page[/url]<br /><br />[url=http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Appendix:Na'vi&amp;diff=8500833&amp;oldid=8461614]Diff for Wiktionary Na'vi Appendix[/url]<br /><br />Unfortunately, in addition to new entries, the diffs will also show all the edits to old entries, so you'll still have to wade through a bunch of extra stuff.&nbsp; But if anyone really wants to see what's new, in lieu of seeing the actual emails from Frommer, this may be one way to do it.<br /><br />&nbsp; - Eri<br />

Yes I guess one could look at the change log of wiki. But rather difficult to read. Just would think its much easier to post new vocabulary somewhere as people notice it.

If I say &quot;He is a hunter&quot;, hunter is a predicative noun; if I say &quot;you seem honest&quot; honest is a predicative adjective; if I say &quot;it seems that you are strong&quot; then &quot;that you are strong&quot; is a predicative phrase, that said, in this case I'd use an inferential in lu instead but the point stands.

I've recently learned (but don't have any documentation to show &nbsp;:-\\ ) that &quot;ALL of the verbal infixes for [u]EVERYTHING[/u] EXCEPT&quot; the attachment function of -iv- after [i]« new, tsun, zene »[/i] etc. &quot;are OPTIONAL&quot;. I was kind of shocked, but after I thought about it a second it made sense based on K.

There's a PARTY in my left cortex (oh and now it's in the right one too)!! Surely this will baffle many, but it makes Na'vi much more interesting and accessible to speakers of languages that commonly do this (and simultaneously lowers the barrier of entry for new learners for whom Na'vi will be their second language).<br /><br />There is only ONE infix that MUST be learned to get going (-iv-). And for those who WANT to INITIALLY think of it as an IndoEuropean infinitive, go right ahead !!<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [b]Häle(frìkìn)luya![/b]<br /><br /> &nbsp; Nawma Sa'nok &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />PS: If anyone feels that this can be moved to a more main topic without proper documentation, then please, move away.

No, but the rattling was so loud I couldn't hear myself think. Turns out it's mounted directly to the motherboard with no access panel, so nearly everything has to be disassembled to get to it. And there there's no part no. to order a new one, assuming I figure out how to pry it off. <br /><br />Yeah, säyom isn't very agentive. But then neither is sänume. Though I must admit the justification for &quot;food&quot; is worse than for &quot;idea&quot; or &quot;instruction&quot;; säyom would perhaps more likely be &quot;appetite&quot; or &quot;hunger&quot;, the abstraction that makes you eat.

... didn't we already know that?<br /><br />[quote author=Frommer via Language Log]<br />First-position infixes indicate tense, aspect, or mood; there are also participial and reflexive infixes in this position, the latter being in “pre-first” position so it can co-occur with other first-position infixes. Second-position infixes indicate speaker attitude—positive orientation, negative orientation, or uncertainty/indirect knowledge. Many of these infixes are optional on the sentence level. (In discourse, however, overt indication of tense or aspect may be required.)<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Wikibooks has been saying for a while (based on the above quote, I assume) that tense and aspect can be omitted when understood from context. &nbsp;I've seen various people assert (based on what, I'm not sure - maybe movie dialog?) that the formality infix can be used initially and then dropped subsequently. &nbsp;And we know that positive/negative infixes aren't required to express a positive/negative orientation: c.f. [b]nga yawne lu oer[/b].<br /><br />So the new bit here is that this also applies to the uncertainty infix [b]&lt;ats&gt;[/b] and the [url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php?title=Verb_syntax#The_Subjunctive]non-modal uses of &lt;iv&gt;[/url] (optative, [b]fte, txo, tsni[/b]). &nbsp;Wrt [b]&lt;ats&gt;[/b], it seems kind of obvious that you can express uncertainty without explicitly marking the verb, given that we have the adverb [b]kxawm[/b]. &nbsp;Or maybe that's not so obvious?<br /><br />Wrt &lt;iv&gt;, I think we still don't understand this morpheme very well, and I'm not sure this clears it up much. &nbsp;We know the optative use is optional, and [url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php?title=Canon#Trials_.26_transitivity]Frommer's email from Feb 15[/url] makes it clear that the forms with (optative) and without (imperative) are equivalent, at least in &quot;modern Na'vi&quot;. &nbsp;As for [b]fte, txo,[/b] and [b]tsni[/b], they seem to me like they're similar enough in form and style to [b]new, tsun,[/b] and [b]zene[/b] that the &quot;attachment&quot; function still requires [b]&lt;iv&gt;[/b] in those cases, and unfortunately your description of your recent learning doesn't give us enough to know for sure.<br /><br />On the other hand...<br /><br />[quote author=Prrton's left cortex]<br />EVERYTHING that can be understood from context can be left out!<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Having this as an explicitly stated principle would be a very, very valuable thing to have. &nbsp;I suspect it applies to much, much more than the mechanics of verbal infixes. &nbsp;It relates to Na'vi as a pro-drop language, for example. &nbsp;We've certainly seen this principle in action many, many times, so it wouldn't surprise me in the least if it were broadly true of the language as a whole. &nbsp;But before making a claim that strong, I'd want to see it from The Man himself, just so that we're all clear about it. &nbsp;It's a pretty big gun, and I'd want it to be fully cocked before we go around shooting it off.<br /><br />If it were true, then I'd even go so far as to say that the pre-first infixes are ALSO optional, [i][b]if they can be understood from context[/b][/i]. &nbsp;Which may not be often, but could certainly happen:<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;[b]Q: Oel sngeykirvä'i set tìkangkemit srak?[/b] &nbsp;[i]I should be beginning the work now, yes?[/i]<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;[b]A: Sngä'i.[/b] &nbsp;[i]Begin.[/i]<br /><br />The latter use of [b]sngä'i[/b] is strictly speaking &quot;wrong&quot;, as the implied sentence is [i]you begin the work[/i] which would require the causative version of the verb. &nbsp;But under the principle of [b]EVERYTHING that can be understood from context can be left out![/b] then it's clear from context that A is saying [i]you begin the work[/i], not [i]the work begins[/i], so all that's needed is the bare verbal root &quot;begin&quot;!<br /><br />(Actually, in this example, it's probably ambiguous whether A is saying [i]you begin[/i] or [i]the work begins[/i]. &nbsp;Either might be intended, and both have the same meaning in this case, so I think here you have an example of grammatically acceptable ambiguity - which is a similar, but different, principle from grammatically acceptable elision of contextually implied elements. &nbsp;But I think you get my point anyway, srak?)<br /><br />[hr]<br /><br />[b]Ma Prrton[/b], I [i][b]strongly[/b][/i] suggest you consider carefully exactly what it is that you have recently learned, and then make a new top-level post explaining it as well as you can. &nbsp;Even if you can't quote sources directly, please paraphrase as well and as closely as you can. &nbsp;I think we all stand to benefit from it, and no matter what the learning is, it would benefit from a separate post.<br /><br /> &nbsp;- Eri<br />

True - It just seemed much less likely, to me, that a word defined to be &quot;suffice&quot; would be used for both usages, and not a word in its own right distinctly for that purpose (like OK is).<br /><br />Because &quot;tam&quot; is used to mean &quot;suffice,&quot; it seemed like there would likely be another word similarly &quot;idiomized&quot; and contracted down (due to excessive use) that would apply to the other meaning that the English &quot;OK&quot; is typically employed for.

Yeah, &quot;OK&quot; is the most widely spoken and understood word all across Earth, but that's the Earth.<br /><br />I suppose, given time, the Na'vi would likely pick up &quot;O[u]key[/u]&quot; from the humans on Pandora, but as you said, they might not even have a word that works like &quot;OK.&quot;<br /><br />With that in mind, I suppose we have to use what words they [i]do[/i] have to translate &quot;OK&quot; into something they'd understand (thinking from the mindset of a human explaining &quot;OK&quot; to a Na'vi).<br /><br />In this way, [b]tam[/b] might be the closest word - Maybe not as close as &quot;fra'u eyawr,&quot; but I think the purpose would be lost with such a long expression, and the contracted version &quot;fra'ey&quot; [i]probably[/i] wouldn't be readily accepted.

Some info on use of the dual from Frommer:<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]<br />The dual forms are expected with things that naturally come in pairs. So if you’re talking about your eyes, ears, feet, or hands, you should use those forms. “My eyes” is therefore “oeyä menari,” not “oeyä aynari.” (I know a little Hebrew, and I think that’s the case in Modern Hebrew as well.) But what if you wanted to say, “Many eyes were staring at him”? There I’d use the regular plural; “many two eyes” doesn’t make sense. (But I should ask my Israeli friends what happens in that case in Hebrew.)<br /><br />I agree that to say “I have two cars,” the dual shouldn’t be enforced.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=me]<br />Q: How many children do you have? (not using dual, because I don't know the answer)<br /><br />A: I have two.<br /><br />Q: How old are they? (now are you using the dual for 'they', or can you use the plural?)<br />[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]<br />As to pronouns, your hypothetical conversation is right on the beam: Once you’ve established that there are two kids, you should use the dual form.<br /><br />A useful guideline is this: If it’s natural to say “both” in English, then it’s likely you should use the dual in Na’vi. In the case of your conversation, the last speaker could have said, “How old are they both?” So s/he would probably use “mefo” for “they.”<br /><br />I myself have trouble remembering to use the dual form when two people are involved, especially in the first person. One thing I’ve found that helps is that if I can substitute “we two” or “the two of us” or “you and I” for “we,” then I know I should use the dual form. Same for the second person forms (“you two”) and third person forms (“those two”).<br />[/quote]<br /><br />And, some info on use of vocative from an older email<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]<br />As for the inconsistency in using the vocative . . . well, let's just say that consultants like me don't have &quot;creative control,&quot; and sometimes a bit of back-fitting is necessary.

<h2>Re: info on duals and vocative</h2>
<h4>willphase</h4>
I read 'shouldn’t be enforced' meaning that it's valid to use either the dual (me-) or the normal plural (ay-) when pluralising things that don't come naturally in pairs (e.g. the 'two cars' example he gave, you could use either).<br /><br />When using a numeral as an adjective attached to a noun it would appear that the noun doesn't take the plural e.g when Norm is talking to Grace he doesn't pluralise 'year' but seems to just attach five as an adjective (and also see [b]'awa tìpawmìri[/b] [url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php?title=Canon#Numerals]here[/url]).<br /><br />so in your example<br /><br />lu oeru hunsìp (I have gunships, using plural, dropping the ay-)<br />lu oeru mehunsìp (I have gunships, using the dual)<br />lu oeru ayhunsìp (I have gunships, using plural)<br />lu oeru munea kunsìp (I have two gunships)<br /><br />would all be fine (in my view).<br /><br />Will

I imagine it's how the person means &quot;pretty&quot;. When we say an animal is beautiful, or a landscape, we don't mean it in the same way as a person being beautiful. I think that's prob'ly the diff, not the animacy of the thing. If you said a person was &quot;lor&quot;, you'd mean that they're beautiful the way you think a horse is beautiful, but not physically attractive.

The physically attractive comparison of a horse vs a person doesn't work though, because Grace uses &quot;sevin&quot; on the Na'vi children, and you would hope there is also not the same sort of attraction there.&nbsp; So if Grace can find that sort of beauty in Na'vi children, why can't someone find that sort of beauty in, say, an animal?<br /><br />It could still be a semantic difference though, for example &quot;sevin&quot; could be something like &quot;Radiant&quot;.

<h2>Re: info on duals and vocative</h2>
<h4>roger</h4>
But we do the same thing in English. Although we deny it, we do speak of children being beautiful the way we speak of adults, or we'll say &quot;she's going to be beautiful when she grows up&quot;, or &quot;he's gonna be a real heart-breaker&quot;, which is just a way of getting around the taboo. Or &quot;my you're getting handsome/pretty&quot;. And we dress up our children to be handsome/beautiful too, even when they're quite young. We even have beauty pageants for little girls, though granted some people do find that rather gross. (Consider the recent controversy in Rio.) By &quot;physically attractive&quot; I don't mean &quot;sexy&quot;, but we do see children as beautiful as fellow human beings in a way we don't see animals or flowers as beautiful. Women will also speak of other women as beautiful (my mom does it constantly), and men sometimes admit that other men are handsome, but that doesn't mean they're gay (at least for women; most straight men are too phobic to be comfortable saying s.t. like that). Why else would little boys dislike being called &quot;pretty&quot;, or would it be an insult to call a little girl &quot;handsome&quot;? &quot;Handsome&quot; is actually a good parallel to &quot;sevin&quot;: it's almost restricted in use for male people. We even speak of newborns as &quot;beautiful&quot; when by all objective criteria they're pretty disgusting looking. (Sorry, I've never seen a baby before about 6 mos. that was cute. But to their parents they're gorgeous.) <br /><br />Certainly a word for human/Na'vi beauty could be lexicalized to be required for all people. <br /><br />Or, if calling a child pretty sets off too many alarms, consider that it's Grace, and that her Na'vi is pretty bad. <br /><br />But I could imagine that if you really anthropomorphize an animal, you might use &quot;sevin&quot;. I know people who would do that with their dogs! If you dress it up in a suit, feed it at the dinner table, and teach it to walk on its hind legs, you'd probably call it &quot;sevin&quot;. I could imagine maybe saying that for a pa'li or esp. your ikran. But I expect that would be a very marked exception, and a wild one would be &quot;lor&quot;. Unless I'm completely misjudging the distinction.

I think at this point we are trying to assign our own views on what the meaning would be...&nbsp; But the truth is we don't know what the distinction is, except that sevin would not be used to describe a language.

In English we distinguish male from female/neuter; Na'vi might divide things differently. Agreed, it would be nice to get this spelled out.

Apologies. Things have been rather crazy with me and posting this keeps slipping my mind:<br /><br />[quote=Karyu Pawl]<br />As you know (I hope), I had nothing to do with the &quot;Activist Survival Guide,&quot; which was written and published without my knowledge. Many of the so-called Na'vi terms in the body of the book are incorrect/misued. The Na'vi-English Dictionary, however, is actually my work, but it's an early, out-of-date version of the glossary that I never thought was going to be published. Since then I've made some changes, and one word that's been changed is kxener.<br /><br />At one point the movie people needed some words for Pandoran foods for a certain scene (which didn't make it to the final cut), so I came up with a few terms. It wasn't important to figure out exactly what kinds of foods they were, so I simply glossed the terms as &quot;kind of fruit or vegetable.&quot; I think there were about a half-dozen of those. Later, when the scene wasn't used, it seemed a pity to have these perfectly good words with such vague and not-very-useful meanings, so I reassigned all of them. Of the words in the ASG, &quot;kì'ong&quot; (stress on 2nd) now means &quot;slow,&quot; and &quot;kxener&quot; (stress on 1st) means . . . smoke.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />[b]Kì'ong[/b] = Slow<br />[b]Kxener[/b] = Smoke

<h4>roger</h4>
Paul has now released the full set of adpositions. Most of them you already know, but there are several new ones. We now also know which cause lenition and which don't. <br /><br />Those not causing lenition are: <br /><br />[u]ä[/u]o &nbsp;\	below <br />[u]e[/u]o \	before, in front of (place) <br />[u]i[/u]o \	above <br />[u]u[/u]o \	behind <br />(all stressed on the first vowel)<br /><br />fa \	\	with (by means of) <br />ftu \	\	from (direction) \	[irregular &quot;ftu sat&quot; with the word &quot;tsa&quot; 'that']\	 <br />hu \	\	with (accompaniment) <br />ka \	\	across <br />kip \	\	among <br />fkip \	\	up among <br />[u]kxam[/u]lä \	through (via the middle of) &nbsp;[note that it does not cause lenition despite the fact that its component ilä does] <br />lok \	\	close to [also a verb 'to approach']<br />[u]lu[/u]ke \	\	without <br />maw \	\	after (time) <br />mì[u]kam[/u] \	between <br />mung[u]wrr[/u] \	except <br />ne \	\	to (direction) <br />[u]nem[/u]fa \	into <br />pxaw \	\	around <br />sìn \	\	on, onto (?) [question mark in the original, evidently not yet decided]<br />ta \	\	from (various uses) <br />ta[u]kip[/u] \	\	from among <br />ta[u]fkip[/u] \	from up among <br />te[u]ri[/u] \	\	about, concerning <br />vay \	\	up to <br /><br /><br />Those causing lenition are: <br /><br />fpi \	for (the benefit or sake of) <br />ìlä \	by, via, following \	\	[stressed on either syllable] <br />mì \	in <br />ro \	at <br />sre \	before (time) <br />wä \	against (as in: fight against) <br /><br />Paul included na and pxel, both &quot;like, as&quot;, among the non-leniting adp. I don't see how they're adpositions. Perhaps they can occur as suffixes, which AFAIK we haven't yet seen? <br /><br />ADDENDUM<br /><br />We get two new temporal adverbs derived from these: [i]mawkrr[/i] &quot;after, afterwards&quot; and [i]srekrr[/i] &quot;before&quot; (&amp; presumably &quot;beforehand&quot;). There is no lenition in the latter; F does not like the sound of *srehrr. <br /><br />Paul confirms that [i]ftu [/i]does not cause lenition apart from [i]sat[/i]. Or rather, [i]Ftu is indeed ADP-. &quot;Ftu sat&quot; is an exception.[/i]

<h2 id="45">minor updates / anticipated confirmations </h2>
<h4>roger</h4>
Several things we suspected are now confirmed. <br /><br />As Taronyu noted, [i]'u[/i] is a noun &quot;thing&quot;. It may be concrete or abstract: an object, a fact, an idea, etc. Assuming glottal stop is a consonant like any other, we'd expect a short plural [i]u[/i]. I've asked Paul if that's really the case, but even if it's a likely source of confusion for English speakers, it wouldn't be a problem for speakers of languages which have a glottal stop, like Arabic or Hawaiian--or Na'vi? &nbsp;<br /><br />[i]Pe [/i]can combine with nouns as either a prefix (leniting) or as a suffix. That is, like [i]tsa-[/i], it's not restricted to the combinations we've been given. So for example there's [i]lì[u]’u[/u]pe / pe[u]lì[/u]’u[/i] &quot;what (word, utterance)&quot;. (One of the few Paul thought important enough to spell out - or maybe it occurs in the script? Note the irregular stress: It seems that the stress needs to be adjacent to the [i]pe [/i]affix; I'll try to come back to this point.) I assume that you'd use that for &quot;what&quot; in &quot;what did you say?&quot;, just as Neytiri uses [i]kempe si nga[/i] for &quot;what are you doing?&quot; in the film. In other words, there is no single word &quot;what?&quot; in Na'vi. <br /><br />[i][u]Fra[/u]tseng [/i]is &quot;everywhere&quot;, and [i][u]tsa[/u]fya [/i]is &quot;that way, like that&quot;, as expected. We can probably fill in the remaining blank cells in the table at Wikibooks in our own notes, but IMO best to leave the book itself alone unless they're confirmed. <br /><br />We have [i][u]fra[/u]to [/i]in our old NYT example, and it's now confirmed as &quot;than all&quot;, the superlative (most, -est) equivalent of [i]to[/i]. <br /><br />[s]And we finally have a partial paradigm for &quot;that, it&quot;. It's a bit irregular: intrans/absolutive [i]tsaw[/i] [sic], erg [i]tsal[/i], acc [i]tsat[/i], plus irregular [i]sat [/i]only after (non-leniting) [i]ftu[/i], as the SG says. We still don't have the genitive or dative, and I don't know if adpositions attach to [i]tsaw [/i]or to the short form [i]tsa-[/i]. I've asked Paul if he can clarify. <br />[/s]<br />The ordinal suffix [i]-ve[/i] in [i][u]'aw[/u]ve[/i] &quot;first&quot; is as expected found on other numbers. However, it's irregular: in some cases it suffixes to the long form, in some cases the short form: <br /><br />Long form: [i][u]pxey[/u]ve[/i] &quot;third&quot;, [i][u]vol[/u]ve[/i] &quot;eighth&quot;<br />Short form: [i][u]mu[/u]ve[/i] &quot;second&quot;, [i][u]tsì[/u]ve[/i] &quot;fourth&quot;, [i][u]pu[/u]ve[/i] &quot;sixth&quot;, [i][u]ki[/u]ve[/i] &quot;seventh&quot;<br />Only form: [i][u]'aw[/u]ve[/i] &quot;first&quot;, [i][u]mrr[/u]ve[/i] &quot;fifth&quot;<br /><br />Higher numbers are predictable from these: short [i]vo[u]mu[/u]ve[/i] &quot;tenth&quot; (octal 12th) and [i]vo[u]sì[/u]ve[/i] &quot;twelfth&quot; (octal 14th), but long [i]vo[u]pey[/u]ve[/i] &quot;eleventh&quot; (octal 13th). <br />(In the interests of completeness, the rest of the provided forms are [i]vo[u]law[/u]ve, vo[u]mrr[/u]ve, vo[u]fu[/u]ve, vo[u]hi[/u]ve, [u]me[/u]volve, mevo[u]law[/u]ve[/i].) <br /><br />ADDENDUM<br />No, [i]*u[/i] &quot;things&quot; would be too likely to cause confusion, even among the Na'vi. In practice, only the long plural [i]ayu[/i] is used. <br /><br />[i]'Aw[u]li[/u]e[/i] is &quot;once&quot;. Note that, unusually for a suffix, the stress is on the [i]li.[/i] I deduce from that that [sup]??[/sup][i]lie[/i] is actually a count noun or adverb &quot;time(s)&quot;, contrasting with non-count [i]krr[/i] &quot;time (duration)&quot;, and would predict that [sup]??[/sup][i]mulie[/i] is &quot;twice&quot;, but neither are attested.

Often &quot;core&quot; forms are irregular, so we might expect only basic/highly frequent preps to lenit. (And note that a derivative of a leniting adp. does not itself lenit.) Also, even among the most common adp, there may once have been some conditioning factor that's since been lost, so that only some of them caused the change. <br /><br />Look at case in English: we only have an oblique in personal pronouns, no longer in nouns or demonstrative PNs, and even among the personal PNs not in &quot;you&quot; or &quot;it&quot;.

There is a noun [i][u]pa[/u]'o[/i] &quot;side&quot;. It looks like this means spatial &quot;side&quot; as in &quot;which side?&quot;, &quot;left side&quot;, etc, not as in anatomical flank/ribs, but that is not clear. Anyway, it appears to form several spatial derivations: <br /><br /> &nbsp; [i][u]fä[/u]pa [/i]&quot;top&quot; N<br /> &nbsp; [i][u]kll[/u]pa [/i]&quot;bottom&quot; N<br /> &nbsp; [i]mìfa [/i](either stress) &quot;inside&quot; N, ADV<br /> &nbsp; [i][u]wrr[/u]pa[/i] &quot;outside&quot; N, ADV<br /><br />I'm guessing that the [i]fä[/i] in [i]fäpa[/i] is the [i]f[/i] in the adposition [i]fkip[/i] &quot;up among&quot;. It's also found in the adverb<br /><br /> &nbsp; [i]ne[u]fä[/u][/i] &quot;up&quot; (direction) ADV<br /><br />to go with our existing [i]ne[u]kll[/u][/i] &quot;down&quot;. <br /><br />Then from (I presume) [i]hapxì[/i] &quot;part&quot; and our andative/venitive? prefixes/serial verbs [i]kä, za,[/i] we get:<br /><br /> &nbsp; [i]za[u]pxì[/u][/i] &quot;front&quot; (front part or section) N<br /> &nbsp; [i]kä[u]pxì[/u][/i] &quot;rear&quot; (rear part or section) N<br /><br />Interesting that coming is in front and going is in back. <br /><br />We've got another new [i]kä[/i] derivative, <br /><br /> &nbsp; [i]kä[u]sa[/u]tseng[/i] &quot;out there&quot; ADV <br /><br />Don't know if that's dissimilation from the other [i]ts[/i] or what.

Something that has been bugging me for awhile is the phonology of 'Rrta...&nbsp; Specifically, it can't validly lenit under the rules of Na'vi phonology.&nbsp; So I emailed Frommer with my question.<br /><br />The short answer is that words that begin with 'rr or 'll don't lenit.&nbsp; So many Earths would be [b]ay'Rrta[/b] with no short plural.&nbsp; At Earth would be [b]ro 'Rrta[/b], etc.<br /><br />The impression I got was that he wasn't 100% happy with this as an answer, but it's not without precedent in other languages.&nbsp; At this point it seems like he doesn't think he's likely to go the alternate route and relax the phonology rules on liquids (Since ayRrta and ro Rrta are perfectly easy to pronounce).

So it would seem that Na'vi has passive participles, but not passive clauses of the &quot;X was said by Y&quot; variety. Paul has said he's avoided that kind of construction, and AFAIK there is no word for the &quot;by&quot; that we would need to create it. Like the lack of /b d g/, this seems to be a point that we were meant to work around.

Passive voice he said would be based on word order emphasis...<br /><br />Eg. Frapol ayerikti teraron - Everyone hunts hexapods<br />Ayerikit frapol teraron - Hexapods are hunted by everyone<br />Ayerikit teraron frapol - Hexapods are hunted by [u]EVERYONE[/u]<br /><br />But working around the lack of &lt;awn&gt; is a lot more cumbersome...<br /><br />Ayerik atawnaron - Hunted hexapods<br />Ayerik a fot fkol teraron - Hexapods that are hunted

It's an assumption, but on the grand scale of assumptions, it seems like a reasonably safe one to make.&nbsp; However knowing is always nicer than assuming.

Since I've been asked to combine releases, I plan on adding to this post over the next couple days, so you might want to check back. <br /><br />[b]conjunctions &amp;c.: however, although, instead[/b]<br /><br />We've finally got Grace's first line! <br /><br />[i]Tsun tivam. Aylì’u ngian nì’it skepek lu.[/i]<br />Not bad. (= [that] can do.) You sound rather formal. (= [your] words, however, are a bit formal.) <br /><br />ngi[u]an[/u] = however ADV<br />[u]ske[/u]pek = formal (stress not confirmed; taken from the film)<br /><br />I don't know if [i]ngian[/i] can be used as a conjunction (&quot;I'll make it [u]however[/u] you like.&quot;) However ([i]ngian[/i]), I imagine that that might be spelled out as &quot;that way which (you like)&quot;, and that [i]ngian[/i] is only used as an adverb, as here. (Frommer only glosses it as an adverb.) <br /><br />We do have a couple other conjunctions, [i]hufwa[/i] I don't have examples of their use: <br /><br />hu[u]fwa[/u] = although CONJ<br />tup = instead of, rather than CONJ<br /><br />I assume [i]hufwa[/i] is a compound of [i]hu[/i] 'together with' and [i]fwa[/i] 'that' (subordinating conjunction), as in &quot;with = given that I want to go&quot; --&gt; &quot;although I want to go&quot;, but it's not too clear to me. <br /><br />It would be cool if we could say ??[i]poru ngatup[/i] &quot;(gave it) to him rather than you&quot;, but I don't know if we can. We'd lose the dative on &quot;you&quot; that way, which could be a problem.

theoretically, i believe it past participle of die is dead, so the verb terkup would take up the &quot;awn&quot; infix, tawnerkup...just have to make sure if u have a noun you add the adjectival prefix accordingly! ...tawtute atawnerkup. (dead skyperson?)

That's why I put the *, it's just a hypothetical construct that would carry similar semantics to the English...&nbsp; It may not be correct Na'vi at all, and I'm not sure I'd personally ever use it that way.&nbsp; The die example is probably bad because the semantic meaning is already mostly covered by a different word anyway.&nbsp; I'm not even sure the past participle in English even words on intransitive verbs...&nbsp; The only examples I can think of off the top of my head are verbs which have gained transitive meanings.<br /><br />But you are correct, literal translation is not usually the best.&nbsp; There may be cases where a past participle would be useful in Na'vi, for sure, but trying to use the best Na'vi grammar to convey the [i]meaning[/i] is what's important, especially since there are numerous ways that the same thing in English can be correctly translated to Na'vi, depending on the intended meaning.

(Cf. one kid’s comment to another when Jake first visits Hometree: “Txopu rä’ä si, lu ketuwongo nì’aw.” Also cf. tsengo ‘somewhere, ’ tuteo ‘someone’) Here, without the –o the opening could be read, “It was the day when . . .”<br /><br />Encounter, meet by chance = ul[u]txa[/u]run. (Cf. ultxa si hu = meet with s.o. intentionally).<br /><br />Nang is always sentence-final and appears with nìtxan.<br /><br />Mì is like en in Spanish—either ‘in’ or ‘on.’ Back (body part) = txal.<br /><br />“I wish” or “Oh that . . .” is nì[u]rang[/u]al ([u]rang[/u]al ‘wish’ v.) followed by the present imperfective subjunctive –irv- for present counterfactuals or the present perfective subjunctive –ilv- for past counterfactuals.<br /><br />Better: Pìsyeng oe ngar. The two future markers have alternate forms with s: -ì(s)y- and -a(s)y- . The s-forms are used optionally to indicate determination to bring something about rather than a simple prediction about the future. (I used them occasionally but probably shd. do so more.)<br /><br />Spark = [u]txep[/u]vi. (-vi is a formative along the lines of what Kirk and Britton have suggested. It’s related to “child” (cf. ’eveng, ’evi; also cf. Malay/Indonesian “anak”) and is used loosely for the spawn of s.t. bigger. So sparks are the children of the fire. (Cf. also Na’vi!)<br /><br />Lefpom is nfp (not for people)—use it for “happy story,” “joyous occasion,” etc. For people: nit[u]ram[/u]. For internal states (happy, sad, hot, cold, hungry, thirsty, . . .) use ’efu + ADJ, as in Eng. “I feel cold.”<br /><br />Tok is actually a transitive verb (!): to be in a place is to occupy that place and thereby change its nature. (2) With krr, txan is the opposite of yol. Cf.: Yola krr, txana krr, ke transten. “It doesn’t matter how long it takes” (a Moat line that I don’t think made it to the final cut).<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I asked him how to indicate simultaneous action, &quot;she ran away laughing.&quot;<br /><br />[quote]I’ve been using tengkrr plus –er-[/quote]<br /><br />Finally,<br /><br />[quote]Chase = [u]fe[/u]wi, catch = [u]stä’[/u]nì. Don’t forget ke along with kawkrr. [/quote]<br /><br /><br />Comments:<br />[list]<br />[*] The perfective if [b]ultxarun[/b] is [b]ultxarolun[/b], so it's a compound verb.<br />[*] [i]Squeeee![/i] New future infixes!<br />[*] Indefinite [b]-o[/b] will make many people happy.<br />[*] Note the instructions about [b]ke[/b] with [b]kawkrr[/b]<br />[/list]

It's actually glossed as &quot;someone&quot;, but I'm trying to keep &quot;X-one&quot; for po-derivatives and &quot;X-body&quot; for tute-derivatives. Not really a meaningful distinction in English, but we may have a difference in Na'vi between tsa'u &quot;that thing&quot;, tsapo &quot;that one (animate)&quot;, and tsatu &quot;that person&quot;: it's not yet clear.

As I understand wm's example of &quot;a deaded yerik&quot; it's showing why it is grammatically wrong with something grammatically wrong in English...&nbsp;  As in something that die was done to (NOT something that itself died) which doesn't really make sense.

A copy of the appendix remains at WP, but is not as up-to-date as the WB version, which has all the words Wm and I have released over the last few days and will be updated w any new words, whereas I don't know if WT will continue to be updated. WB does [b]not[/b] have proper names, except for [i]Na'vi [/i]and [i]Eywa[/i], as their stress has not been confirmed, nor does it have the various plant names, and won't unless Paul releases them directly. That is, apart from presumed short plural forms, which have been added in even if not attested, and presumed case forms of the pronouns, WB is strictly Frommerian, and no longer relies on the Survival Guide or game for anything, apart from a few illustrations from the songs in the SG (which are Frommerian). <br /><br />It and Taronyu's dict will be cross-checked over the next few days, which should hopefully catch any errors which have crept into either.

<h2>Re: A collection</h2>
<h4>roger</h4>
It doesn't actually seem to be a problem. They're in set positions, mostly just in one, and after you see the forms over and over, I expect you'd get a feel for them. A bit like worrying that Turkish vowel harmony would obscure the underlying word--after a while, you don't even notice it. <br /><br />Since every single verb we have apart from compounds is at most disyllabic, then they're pretty straightforward to parse: Consonant, infix, remainder of verb root. <br /><br />We have 31 infixes, counting fused ones. If the intentional can be used in the non-future, that would grow to 34. There are lots of languages which have more case-number-gender forms on their nouns or PNG-TAM forms on their verbs than 34, often quite irregular, and their speakers don't have any problem!

<h2>Re: Wiktionary appendix now at Wikibooks</h2>
<h4>roger</h4>
I had to divide up the dictionary because of the limitations of Wikibooks: it would only display through S even without the recent additions. I could have made each letter a separate page, but IMO it's more useful to keep things together. And the way the templates are currently designed, the link in s.t. like &quot;[i]haryu,[/i] short plural of [i]karyu[/i]&quot; will only work if [i]haryu[/i] and [i]karyu[/i] are on the same page. Short plurals of glottal-stop words are vowel initial, so they're on the same page. Likewise k, kx, and h, even though /h/ is not velar. I really don't want to redo the templates (or ask Sebastian Goll to redo them, since he did all the work!), and then go through and update all the links, just because of technical issues at WB which we might be able to get resolved. The names of the pages were only chosen because I had to call them [i]something[/i]; the consonants are not classified that way anywhere in the text. If they're too confusing, I can try moving them to s.t. like &quot;glottal series&quot;, &quot;velar series&quot;, etc. In fact, I think I'll do that now. <br /><br />Okay, VWYZ are now at &quot;other voiced&quot;. Maybe s.o. here can come up w a better name? These are a semi-natural group because they are the most restricted consonants: They cannot occur at the end of a syllable and yet cannot initiate clusters at the beginning either. Plus they retain alphabetic order, and so are intuitive as a group that way.

<br />[quote]&quot;After i, u, and o, it’s just ä, not yä.&quot; (the genitive of words ending in vowels)[/quote]<br /><br />As we know from examples, the other cases do not use their &quot;non-vowel-form&quot; (-ìl, -ur, -it) after i, u and o. So it's just a &quot;genitive speciality&quot;. Really a weird case in Na'vi!<br /><br />By the way: I'm looking forward to see your concise grammar published!

Seems like tsa always gets something following it, with a -w if nothing else.&nbsp; I don't see why mesaw/etc wouldn't be allowed.

The way I see it is that the POSS ending is universally [i][desc=our sole vowel-based case ending]-ä[/desc][/i], but when it follows another lax vowel, you insert a [desc=y][j][/desc] to ease pronunciation. Then, what we see here is not really an exception, but the influence of a phonotactic rule.<br /><br />Of course, as soon as someone points out a single occurrence where there are two lax vowels side by side in a word, my whole theory goes down the drain. :D<br /><br />(I'm aware that tenseness and laxness are undefined with respect to Na’vi, but [[i][/i]u], [[i][/i]o], and [[i][/i]i] would be considered tense in English, just as [desc=i's lax pair in Na’vi too][ɪ][/desc], [desc=it disappears anyway because of the no-doubled-vowels rule][æ][/desc], and [desc=explicitly defined as such by Frommer in the LL post][ɛ][/desc] would be lax. I think [a] could go either way, so I just assumed it would be lax too.)

[i]Tsawt[/i] and [i]tsawri[/i] may have these forms because they are colloquial contractions of [i]tsa'ut, tsa'uri[/i], which are perfectly regular with those forms.

We've not had any examples, as far as I know, that really hindge on whether of not the /y/ is there in situations like you've listed.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I don't know if this makes any difference, but maybe we see this &quot;long&quot; genitive attaching to Na'vi and Aymokri because these are parts of &quot;proper nouns&quot;?

<h2>Re: Genitive case refinement; declension of tsaw</h2>
<h4>roger</h4>
Hey, I got an answer on this one! <br /><br />[quote author=Frommer]As you've said, there's not much difference between -iä and -iyä (perhaps no difference at all), so it's essentially a spelling question.<br /><br />Here's what's out there:<br /><br />-iä<br /><br />1. muiä (LEXICON)<br />2. niä (LEXICON)<br />3. menariä (VIDEO GAME)<br /><br />(Fmawnit menariä ke tsun oe spivaw. 'I can't believe what I'm seeing with my eyes.')<br /><br />-iyä<br /><br />4. Na'viyä (SCRIPT)<br />5. Aymokriyä (LEXICON, SCRIPT)<br />6. ritiyä (VIDEO GAME)<br /><br />1 and 2 are roots, so they shouldn't be a problem. 3 through 6 are genitive forms. So if the official spelling is -iyä, the only outlier is 3, which I'll change.<br /><br />Bottom line: the genitive for bases ending in -i is -yä. Apologies for going back and forth on this.<br /><br />One more inconsistency:<br /><br />For bases in -a, the gen. was -yä in 3 cases (tompayä, Eywayä, tìska'ayä), but there was also Omatikayaä. I feel comfortable leaving that last word alone, as an exceptional form: *Omatikayayä doesn't seem stable--I can see yayä &gt; yaä.[/quote]

<h4>`Eylan Ayfalulukanä</h4>
Maybe what to do is set a date for a 'clean break' from the current way of doing things, say April 1st. On that date, a second canon page would begin. This page could be organized completely differently, perhaps containing the contents of the old canon reorganized in a way that is more logical and relevant going forward. From that point on, all the existing links into the old canon would still be valid, but subsequent users could link to either old or new material on the new page.

Good ideas, ma 'eylan.<br /><br />The only problem I see about this is, that a &quot;more logical&quot; way would include subsections, e. g. &quot;Infixes&quot;, &quot;Semantics&quot;, etc. And K.

On the one hand, there are more and more postings like &quot;I'm quite sure that this was mentioned by Frommer somewhere, but I can't find it&quot; or &quot;Are there any approved examples for XYZ?&quot;, but on the other hand the wiki-canon - a tool, where such problems could be solved easily - is neglected.<br /><br />Well ...

[quote author=Frommer]As you've said, there's not much difference between -iä and -iyä (perhaps no difference at all), so it's essentially a spelling question.<br /><br />Here's what's out there:<br /><br />-iä<br /><br />1. muiä (LEXICON)<br />2. niä (LEXICON)<br />3. menariä (VIDEO GAME)<br /><br />(Fmawnit menariä ke tsun oe spivaw. 'I can't believe what I'm seeing with my eyes.')<br /><br />-iyä<br /><br />4. Na'viyä (SCRIPT)<br />5.

So if the official spelling is -iyä, the only outlier is 3, which I'll change.<br /><br />Bottom line: the genitive for bases ending in -i is -yä. Apologies for going back and forth on this.<br /><br />One more inconsistency:<br /><br />For bases in -a, the gen. was -yä in 3 cases (tompayä, Eywayä, tìska'ayä), but there was also Omatikayaä. I feel comfortable leaving that last word alone, as an exceptional form: *Omatikayayä doesn't seem stable--I can see yayä &gt; yaä.[/quote]<br /><br />So is it [i]-yä[/i] again for all V-ending stems?

<h2 id="58">A long answer to a quick question</h2>
<h4>TehMightyPirate</h4>
So, in a spur of the moment thing I e-mailed Frommer about 2 hours ago with a &quot;quick question&quot; on the pronunciation of &quot;oe&quot; and it's apparent two forms &quot;oh-eh&quot; (two syllables) and &quot;weh&quot; (one syllable). I just got this:<br /><br />[quote author=Paul Frommer][desc=Thanks for your question.]Ngeyä tìpawmerì oe seiyi irayo.[/desc]<br /><br />Yes, you're right: the &quot;oe&quot; element in personal pronouns is sometimes pronounced in two syllables (&quot;oh-eh&quot;) and sometimes one (&quot;weh&quot;).<br /><br />The general rule is that all vowels in a word are pronounced separately. The most extreme of example of this (so far!) is meoauniaea, which has 8 distinct syllables, all gliding smoothly from one to another.<br /><br />But with the &quot;oe&quot; words, which are among the most common in the language, it's probable that more compact pronunciations evolved. People contract and shorten words all the time, especially the ones they use most frequently. In English, for example, &quot;I am&quot; is usually &quot;I'm&quot; in casual speech: two syllables have become one. The difference is that in English we change the spelling and punctuation to go along with the streamlined pronunciation while in Na'vi we don't. But the principle is the same.<br /><br />So in careful, formal speech, &quot;oeru&quot; might be 3 full syllables. (And note that in honorific style, it's definitely 3: oheru.) But in ordinary conversation, &quot;oeru&quot; is normally &quot;weh-ru.&quot;<br /><br />The rule for these pronouns is as follows:<br /><br />If the &quot;oe&quot; element comes at the end of the word, pronounce the two vowels separately; otherwise pronounce them as &quot;weh.&quot; So oe and moe have two syllables and ayoe has three, but oel has one. However, in the dual and trial forms prefixed with m and px respectively, the vowels of oe are ALWAYS pronounced separately. So, for example, oel is one syllable but moel and pxoel are two.<br /><br />[desc=I hope that this explanation is clear to you now.]Sìlpey oe tsnì fìtìoeyktìng* law livu ngaru set.[/desc]<br /><br />[desc=Good day to you.]Trr lefpom livu ngar.[/desc]<br /><br />ta P.<br /><br />*Tìoeyktìng = explanation, which contains the root oeyk 'cause' -- two syllables, stressed on the second: o.EYK. So tìoeyktìng should have four syllables: tì.o.EYK.tìng. I bet, though, that in casual speech on Pandora it's pronounced in three, as if it were tì.WEYK.tìng. Guess we'll need a native informant to find out for sure! :-)[/quote]<br /><br />Woohoo, a ton of info and a 2 hour turn around time. Karyu Pawl lu txantsan! :)<br /><br />(Translation in the email by me)

Ok I think that is the quickest response I've gotten to a question by far.&nbsp; I had the stress on yemfpay wrong (See, told you it was the one I was not sure about), but Frommer confirmed the rest were correct.&nbsp; The list of eoio was indeed a mistake and it should have been 'eoio.&nbsp; Yemfpay si is the verb for dipping, yemfpay is a noun for dipping or immersion.

A thought on this, I feel the old combined one petered out because we built up this huge unmanageable list of questions. Perhaps a good solution to this is we build up questions each week and then send out one email each week (like on a Friday or something). Then, we can mark questions that have been answered and take any unanswered ones and add them to next weeks question email. This should yield fast results, not overwhelm Frommer (too much), and allow us to have an easy system for asking and organizing questions and answers.<br /><br />Thoughts?

I think that is also a good idea.<br /><br /><br />This goes along with the pluralizing of words like yerik, which may be what wm.annis was getting at in the first place but it was a little vague to me.<br />[list]<br />[li]if words such as &quot;yerik&quot; get pluralized to &quot;ayerik&quot; creating a diphthong situation, would they be pronounced &quot;ay.e.rik&quot; or as &quot;a.yer.ik&quot;[/li]<br />[/list]

One of the most striking grammatical features of this new bit of Frommerian corpus is a compound adverbial phrase: [b]nìfya'o letrrtrr[/b] Glossed &quot;in-manner ordinary.&quot;&nbsp; The adverbial prefix encompasses not just [b]fya'o[/b], but the phrase [b]fya'o letrrtrr[/b].

A couple words that got tossed in a response from Kawyu Pawl...<br /><br />As a derivation, le[u]sar[/u] means &quot;useful&quot;.<br />What seems like the interjection &quot;Well...&quot;, tse.<br />And a word skxom for chance, oppertunity.<br /><br />le[u]sar[/u] - adj. useful (fìtìkangkem layu [b]lesar[/b] nìtxan frapor) (Stress assumed based off ALL other le- based derivations)<br />skxom - n. chance (pamrel sayi trray krr a [b]skxom[/b] latsu oeru)<br />tse - intj. well ([b]Tse[/b]...&nbsp; zene pivlltxe san pxìm tsafya lu sìk)<br /><br />And another example of the -o suffix with ayupxareo (Some messages)<br /><br />Also, if you write to Paul in Na'vi, it may delay the response a bit because he likes to respond in kind, but wants everything to be perfect before he sends it, so it can take time.&nbsp; Ironically, after responding to my email in Na'vi, he sent another message a few minutes later correcting something.&nbsp; I wouldn't bother mentioning this, except the correction itself carries some implications on usage.<br /><br />He had said &quot;Tsa'u kop krrnekx&quot; but corrected it to &quot;Tsakem kop krrnekx&quot; because actions take time, not things or ideas.&nbsp; The implication I got off that is that if you know you are talking about something specific like actions, you shouldn't use the generic 'u.

[/quote]<br /><br />And he comments:<br /><br />[quote=&quot;Karyu Pawl&quot;]Quick comment re &quot;nìfya'o letrrtrr&quot;:<br /><br />I gather this has caused some consternation. If so, that's not surprising, since on the surface it looks as if an adjective as modifying an adverb. As you've realized, the bracketing is really nì-[fya'o letrrtrr], so it's not as weird as it seems--provided, as you say, you accept that an affix can be applied to a phrase. (I was trying without success to think of places that English does that, along the lines of &quot;He answered very in-your-facely&quot; or &quot;That was an out-of-the-boxish solution.&quot;)<br /><br />But it's a useful construction, since it's completely productive: if you can modify fya'o with an adjective, you can turn that phrase into a manner adverbial with nìfya'o. True, there is overlap between one-word adverbs and these constructions, but that's not unusual: in English we can say &quot;She spoke clearly&quot; or &quot;She spoke in a clear way.&quot; (For the first sentence, though, nìlaw is ambiguous just as &quot;clearly&quot; is in English: Poe poltxe nìlaw means either &quot;She spoke clearly&quot; or &quot;Clearly, she spoke.&quot; However, Poe poltxe nìfya'o alaw can only mean &quot;She spoke clearly.&quot;)<br /><br />With the limited lexicon we currently have, it's natural for people to try to use the derivational affixes freely to fill gaps. But in fact they aren't freely productive, which is why forms with tì-, sä-, le-, and nì- need to be listed in the lexicon. It's not a given that any particular root can take these affixes, and even when the form exists, the meaning won't necessarily be predictable. (E.g. tìrol means 'song' rather than 'singing.' And in English, &quot;ordinarily&quot; does not mean &quot;in an ordinary manner.&quot;) But you don't have that problem with a nìfya'o adverbial--the process is always productive and always interpreted as a manner adverbial.<br />[/quote]

A few answers to my questions: <br /><br />When asked which of several defs of 'responsible' [i]kllfro'[/i] is:<br />[quote]<br />Yes, it is a compound, and the first element is indeed kll 'ground.' But I haven't yet decided on what the fro' part means.<br /><br />The idea is to be responsible for someone or something--that is, having s.o. or s.t. as your &quot;job, duty, or area of concern&quot; (as my desk dictionary puts it).<br /><br />The line in the original script was Moat's, when she tells Neytiri that she (Neytiri) will be the one to ensure Jake's progress in learning the ways of the Na'vi:<br /><br />[i]Pori zene kllfrivo' nga.[/i] 'He is your responsibility.'<br />[/quote]<br />On what happens with infixing stressed syllabic C's:<br />[quote]<br />In a case like frrfen, where the stress is on frr, the ipfv remains frrfen:<br /><br />frrfen (stress on 1st) + &lt;er&gt; --&gt; *ferrrfen &gt; frrfen<br /><br />When the stress is not on the pseudovowel, however, it drops:<br /><br />plltxe (stress on 2nd) + &lt;ol&gt; --&gt; *pollltxe &gt; poltxe<br />[/quote]<br />When asked about ay sometimes being a diphthong, and sometimes V+C:<br />[quote]<br />Keep in mind that ay, ey, aw, ew are diphthongs as well as VC's. (In tsawl, for example, you know the aw is a diphthong, because if it weren't, you'd have a syllable ending in two C's, which is prohibited.)<br /><br />So the syllabification will tell you which you have. For example:<br /><br />tswayon is tsway.on, indicating that the ay is a diphthong.<br />But layon is la.yon, indicating that the y is a consonant. <br /><br />(I'm not sure there's much consequence to these distinctions--the pronunciations seem pretty much the same.)<br /><br />Similar things hold for w.<br /><br />[...]<br />In general, the tendency with VCV is to syllabify as V.CV rather than VC.V (assuming there's a choice--i.e., that C is one of the consonants that can appear in syllable-final position).<br /><br />So the default is V.gV, as in mu.ge, a.u.gi.a, etc.<br /><br />For 'egeg, the word may have originated as a reduplicated form: *'eg'eg &lt; 'eg + 'eg, which would favor 'eg.eg.<br /><br />Same with kagagag, which is clearly onomatopoetic: kag + ag + ag (a bang with two echos), hence kag.ag.ag.

We should verify the stress of every case of every PN of every number, just in case there are irregularities in there. That would be an awful thing to have to re-learn. Wouldn't be too hard to draw up a table &amp; see if he agrees with it. <br /><br />Should have: oe, oeg, awga, ga, po, fo, ca, caw, ca'u, sa, saw, sa'u, fì'u, fì'po, etc., and whatever the plurals of those last two are. <br /><br />Would be worth asking if foan, foe, ngan, ngae, or 1pl are possible PN forms.

Not to mention every case where there is an ambiguous distinction between diphthong and VCV.&nbsp; I've actually got a little perl script that splits out the syllables of words, it would be trivial to modify it to scour the word list and split out any word where such a thing occurs.&nbsp; Perhaps even clarify the syllabification of any occurrence of &quot;VtsV&quot; as &quot;V.tsV&quot; or &quot;Vt.sV&quot;, as well as words that are VCV where C can be either a coda or onset.&nbsp; (Presently my script prefers diphthongs over consonants, and onsets over codas, as that seems to be Na'vi's preferences.&nbsp; But as I said it would be trivial to modify it to spit out all ambiguous cases from the current vocabulary.)

Since F follows morphology, and underlines entire stressed syllables, this would only be an issue where unstressed syllables meet within roots. Since roots are generally fairly short, there are few instances where this would even come up. AFAIK, so far this has only been relevant for w, y, ', and g, and my suspicion is that the latter two are an influence of English. And if F notes that there is little distinction in stressed examples, there's likely to be even less in unstressed examples where it's not marked in the vocab.

You are most likely correct there, but it's good to get an understanding. &nbsp;Of all the diphthong examples, only [u]pi[/u]zayu had an unstressed syllabic pair... &nbsp;But if the -yu is the same -yu as elsewhere, it's likely not a diphthong. &nbsp;(I'm inclined to believe it is CVCV there.) &nbsp;There were no words where VtsC?V occurred in any unstressed syllable.<br /><br />Words where it's VCV on an unstressed syllable, and it is not clear from morphology...<br /><br />a[b]t[/b]o[b]k[/b]i[u]ri[/u]na'<br />kì[b]t[/b]e[u]'e[/u]<br />[u]me[/u]oau[b]n[/b]ia[u]e[/u]a<br />[u]snu[/u]mì[b]n[/b]a<br />tsap[u]'a[/u]lu[b]t[/b]e<br /><br />So it's a pretty short list. &nbsp;I'm inclined to believe that these are all regular.<br /><br />If anyone wants to look at this on there own, this is the perl regex I'm using to split the syllables out - though this one is not the one I modified to find contested consonants.<br />[spoiler][code] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\G<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(?| # C?C/VC? syllables<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;( # C, CC or (null)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(?:[csf]|ts)?<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(?:[mgrlwy]|[ptk]x?|ng?)?<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| # Additional C only forms<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[hvz']<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(?| # Normal vowels<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;([iìuoä])() # Empty capture because the ?| doesn't seem to work right<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| # Possible diphthongs<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;([ea])([wy](?!rr|ll))?<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;( # Coda - don't be greedy<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# Next syllable gets any contended consonants<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(?:['mgrl]|[pk]x?|ng?|tx)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(?![iìuoäeax]|rr|ll)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| # Special case coda for T, it is given up to a s for ts<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# Removing this part and adding t to pk above will give the T to the coda<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;t(?![siìuoäeax]|rr|ll)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)?<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| # CV psuedovowel syllables only<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;([csfmgrlwyhvz']|[pk]x?|t[sx]?|ng?)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(rr|ll)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/gcix[/code]<br />This returns the onset in $1, the vowel or psuedovowel (But not the second half of a diphthong) in $2, the y or w from a diphthong in $3 and the coda in $4. &nbsp;When there are disputes, it prefers diphthongs over consonants and onsets over codas. &nbsp;Theoretically to be the most flexible it should give a disputed T to the coda and let the program decide what to do with it, but there are so few cases where the T wouldn't go to a TS that it isn't a huge deal. &nbsp;For pure scientific notation input, however, it should always give the T to the coda in a ts case. &nbsp;Note that words like &quot;'e.wll&quot; are not considered disputed because the consonant MUST go to the CV syllable.<br />[/spoiler]

oeyä ean-a txìm a-tsawl &quot;my big blue butt&quot; <br /><br />2 adj may also occur on the same side of the N, so the combo should be legal. But yes, don't we have &quot;sì&quot; linking adj?<br /><br />More general question: can the N be dropped out of an NP? Does the adj then take the adp/case? <br /><br />It would also be nice to fill out the answer-word chart: ?kawtseng &quot;nowhere&quot;, ?kawpo &quot;no-one&quot;, no reason, no-how, no way, no (action), no (word), and similarly for which (?pefo &quot;which one&quot;), proximals &amp; distals, some-, every-, other-, same-. And the plurals: does [i]pesu[/i] &quot;who?&quot; have a plural [i]fesu[/i] when you know multiple people are involved? The plural of [i]tsa'u[/i] is [i]sa'u[/i]; is the pl. of [i]fì'u[/i] therefore [i]ayfì'u[/i], or [i]fayu[/i]? Is there a contrast or parallel between [i]sa'u[/i] and ?[i]tsayu[/i]? Etc. <br /><br />Also, confirm that all adp, including things like teri, na, and pxel, can occur as suffixes/enclitics as well as as preps. It seems from what he's written that teri is the prep. equivalent of the case -ìri. We should ask that explicitly. (Who knows? It might be possible to get an acc. prep. ??teti, or an ergative ??tel.) <br /><br />Have we ever gotten an answer on those mysterious verbal infixes? tovaron, tevaron, telaron, tairon? They may be spurious, but we should get them out of the way if they are. <br /><br />Also, those odd adverbs that look like adjectival forms of stative verbs:<br /><br />lìm &quot;be far&quot; --&gt; alìm &quot;in the distance&quot;. Perhaps stative verbs cannot take the participle? Is the form ?lìma with the opposite word order? Is this a subord. form lexicalized as an adverb, or is there s.t. more productive going on?

About ay/ey/aw/ew as diphthongs or VC, Frommer said, that<br />[quote]<br />I'm not sure there's much consequence to these distinctions--the pronunciations seem pretty much the same.[/quote]<br /><br />Well ... it *does* matter in the case of arranging the words in a dictionary. Not, if you do it according to English rules, where e. g. &quot;i&quot; and &quot;ì&quot; or &quot;a&quot; and &quot;ä&quot; fall into the same category (which doesn't make sense from the Na'vi standpoint), but if you try to put the words in an alphabet, which takes respect to the Na'vi sound-system, &quot;ay&quot; as a diphthong is a separate sound, so that words starting with &quot;ay&quot; don't just get in the article about &quot;a&quot;, but get their own article. The same about the other diphthongs and pseudovowels (&quot;rr&quot; isn't &quot;r+r&quot;, and therefore to put between &quot;rp&quot; and &quot;rs&quot;, it's a complete different sound, so it is placed *outside* (e. g. *after*) the other &quot;r&quot;s).<br /><br />So, if you have an Na'vi alphabet like the one in our [url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php?title=Vocabulary]wiki-vocabulary [/url], where e. g. the diphthong &quot;ay&quot; has it's own right apart from &quot;a&quot;, uncertainties cause trouble. Example:<br /><br />maw [maw] (Adp–) after (time).<br />mawey [ma.ˈwɛj] (Adj) calm.<br />mawkrr [maw.kr̩ː] (Adv) after (time), afterwards.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;Mawey&quot; is given as maWEY, so it's clear, that the -aw- here isn't the diphthong. So according to the Na'vi alphabet, &quot;mawey&quot; should be put BEFORE &quot;maw&quot;, because there the &quot;aw&quot; is the diphthong and the alphabetical order is: a, aw, ay. So any words, where there *is* -aw-, but *not* the &quot;diphthong-aw&quot;, should preceed all words with &quot;diphthong-aw&quot;s. (Until now I didn't put &quot;mawey&quot; in front of the others, but to maintain consistency, it should be done.)<br /><br />So in the case of sorting words in the dictionary correctly, the difference between the diphthong and the VC very well *has* consequences.<br /><br />Of course, maybe this isn't a problem to many people, but just to the ones, who write the dictionaries, but to them it is. And since all the other people want to use the dictionaries, it may become a problem to them too, because they had to look up &quot;mawey&quot; not after, but before &quot;maw&quot;.

<h2 id="62">declension of nouns ending in diphthongs; fì- and tsa-</h2>
<h4>wm.annis</h4>
A few refinements...<br /><br />I asked, [i]First, I say that &quot;For declension, the diphthongs count as consonants. I'm 95% certain this is true (kifkeyit, etc.)[/i]<br /><br />[quote=&quot;Karyu Pawl&quot;]No, not quite. I hadn't written up the rule, but this is what I've been doing with diphthong-final N's, which feels right in my mouth and ear:<br /><br />A: -ìl<br />P: -it, -ti<br />D: -ru, -ur<br />G: -ä<br />T: -ri<br /><br />(I think I've been consistent, but if you come across places I haven't, please let me know.)<br /><br />Sorry to give you a headache with this. One generalization is that the single-C allomorphs are out. Other than that, I guess it's some from Column A, some from Column B. Maybe you can find a way to convey this without having to take up space with another chart.<br /><br />For the record, I went through the lexicon and found 19 diphthong-final N's:<br /><br />-AW: fpxafaw, swizaw, taw, tìsraw<br />-AY: holpxay, nguway, reypay, tìngay, tsray, txampay, way, yemfpay<br />-EW: fahew, flew, txantstew<br />-EY: kifkey, kxeyey, tìrey, vey<br /><br />(20 if we count tìletìngay. &lt;g&gt;)[/quote]<br /><br />I asked, [i]Second, I say that the near demonstrative is &quot;fì-&quot; (pl. &quot;fay-&quot;, or just &quot;fì-&quot; with lenition); the distant demonstrative is &quot;tsa-&quot; (pl. tsay- or just &quot;tsa-&quot; with lenition).<br /><br />I worry about the distal deixis prefix, because you have given ussa'u as a plural of tsa'u.[/i]<br /><br />[quote]OK, except that for the plurals, there's no fì-/tsa- plus lenition option. That is,<br /><br />fìketuwong 'this alien'<br />fayhetuwong 'these aliens'<br />tsaketuwong 'that alien'<br />tsayhetuwong 'those aliens'<br /><br />But not *fìhetuwong, *tsahetuwong. (The nice thing about short plurals is that they save you a syllable; here that doesn't happen, so there's no raison d'être for the short forms with demonstratives.)<br /><br />The plural of the stand-alone demonstrative pronoun tsa'u is (ay)sa'u, which follows the regular rules.<br /><br />I don't see anything worrisome here, but if I'm missing something (which is entirely possible), let me know.[/quote]<br /><br />When I asked for clarification about the pronouns, <br /><br />[quote]Right. With the pronouns, the order of elements is ay+tsa+'u rather than the expected tsa+ay+'u, etc.[/quote]

<h2 id="63">About Subordination</h2>
<h4>Taronyu</h4>
So, I asked Frommer some questions. It's probably best to just paste both emails here:<br /><br />[quote=Tarskxawngonyu]Relative clauses run by arranging their contents to the left or right of an a, sort of like adjectives. Now, with adjectives, I fpìl, but I'm not sure, that you can do this: txana txana trr lehrrap akawng &quot;a very very dangerous bad day&quot;. Now, it makes sense to me that you should be able to do the same with relative clauses, but I can't seem to work out how that should work. From some examples, like when using a krr, you use a comma to end the subordinate clause - which I assume would mean an intonational pause. But does that mean that there isn't a lexical item to signal the end of a clause? I prepared the following sentence as an example of what I think we can do:<br /><br />Utralmì a nantang ke namew fpilve' ikranur a mì saw 'upxaret a tsìyun wivìntxu futa pol tsengit tamok fa nguway tìsusi.<br /><br />What I had meant to say was: &quot;The nantang, which is in the tree, did not want to send to the ikran in the sky messages which would show that he was there by howling.&quot; As you can see, it's a mess. Now, in English orthography, you need commas to properly show the embedded structures. What about in Na'vi? Does the above work? Thanks for helping to clear this up![/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]Ma Taronyu,<br /><br />Now THAT is a sentence! :-)<br /><br />OK, let's see . . .<br /><br />First of all, your premises are correct: RC's can precede or follow their heads just as adjectives can. (In fact, under some analyses, adjectives are simply reduced RC's: ikran atsawl &lt; ikran a lu tsawl, just as an English phrase like &quot;something strange&quot; could be thought of as a reduced form of &quot;something that is strange.&quot;)<br /><br />You're also right that there's no lexical item to mark the end of a subordinate clause, although in speech, pauses and intonation would help. I haven't thought too much about whether written Na'vi should do something with punctuation, the way English does. But keep in mind that the situation with commas is complicated in English (and probably other languages, although I can't vouch for that) by the fact that there are restrictive/non-restrictive distinctions:<br /><br />(1) The nantang that is in the tree is looking at you.<br />There are five nantangs around--I'm talking about the one in the tree. So this is a RESTRICTIVE RC.<br /><br />(2) The nantang, which is in the tree, is looking at you.<br /><br />There's only one nantang in the picture, and we've already identified it. &quot;Which is in the tree&quot; just gives additional, optional information. This is a NON-RESTRICTIVE RC.<br /><br />Notice the differences in English: commas in one case but not the other, and, according to certain English teachers, the difference between &quot;that&quot; and &quot;which.&quot; (That distinction is not always observed, even by good writers.)<br /><br />Should Na'vi do something similar? I don't know. We'll see . . .<br /><br />Now back to your phrase and sentence. You're basically correct on both. But looking at the details, I'd suggest the following revisions:<br /><br />(3) txana txana trr lehrrap akawng<br /><br />Keep in mind that &quot;very&quot; is nìtxan; &quot;txan&quot; means &quot;much.&quot; So you can't use it this way. What you want is:<br /><br />(4) kawnga trr lehrrap nìtxan nìtxan<br /><br />(I'm not sure if Na'vi style allows the repeating of adjectives and adverbs for emphasis, as English does. I'll have to think about that.)<br /><br />As for your monster:<br /><br />(5) Utralmì a nantang ke namew fpilve' ikranur a mì saw 'upxaret a tsìyun wivìntxu futa pol tsengit tamok fa nguway tìsusi.<br /><br />I don't think it's that much of a mess--it's actually pretty good! Just a few suggestions:<br /><br />(a) After &quot;new,&quot; you usually use the simple subjunctive: fpive'<br />(b) If you want &quot;messages,&quot; then it's upxaret, not 'upxaret<br />(c) &quot;There&quot; is tsatseng<br />(d) In this case I'd use terok rather than tamok: you're not talking about a point in time but rather about something that extended over a period. In fact, if you translated tok as &quot;occupy,&quot; then you'd be likely to say &quot;the place he was occupying,&quot; which makes the imperfective nature of the verb clear.<br />(e) To nominalize si-construction verbs where the non-verbal part is a noun, see if you can get away with just using the noun. In this case, I'd drop the last word.<br /><br />With all the revisions:<br /><br />(6) Utralmì a nantang ke namew fpive' ikranur a mì saw upxaret a tsìyun wivìntxu futa pol tsatsengit terok fa nguway.<br /><br />A complicated sentence, but definitely grammatical. (Just so I understand, though: The nantang got up into the tree by howling? How did that happen? And can nantangs climb trees anyway? &lt;g&gt;)[/quote]

That would work. I was trying to highlight that both constructions could be grammatical, currently, as we don't have a complex system for clause placement work out. Yours does make more sense, however, but it's not necessarily how the Na'vi would do it. <br /><br /><br />I think the main thing to take away is that we can stack clauses, and that there's no marker given for them if this is done. I've been curious about this, before.

I actually came across an interesting situation relating to subordination.&nbsp; I was writing a sentence out &quot;Oel futa tì'awve nìftue lu fpìl&quot; which as I understand should be perfectly fine...&nbsp; Then I realized that I could have just dropped the oel because it was in the prior clause.&nbsp; But then suddenly &quot;Futa tì'awve nìftue lu fpìl&quot; seemed ambiguous if it meant &quot;tì'awve fpìl&quot; or &quot;oel fpìl&quot;.&nbsp; I mean contextually here it's obvious, but if it were a different sentence, it might not have been so.&nbsp; For example.<br /><br />[b]Oe ngaru polawm.&nbsp; Futa ngal tì'eyngit omum fpìl.[/b]<br /><br />Are you thinking it or am I thinking it?

Right that's how it normally would be, but because the subordinate is wholly contained within the main clause before the verb, does IT then give the contextual subject, or does the prior sentence?

I call it a part answer...&nbsp; The question of plural question words is still open.&nbsp; Certainly following the fì + ay = fay doesn't work because &quot;pay&quot; seems like it would be too easily confused with water in some cases.&nbsp; Pey would be a lenited number 3...&nbsp; Peay is a moutful, so fe does seem the most promising there.&nbsp; So I think that should still get asked.&nbsp; IMO anyway.

<h2 id="64">if vs whether - 'ftxey...fuke'</h2>
<h4>willphase</h4>
Triggered by discussion [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/beginners/if/]here[/url] about 'if'...<br /><br />[quote=me]<br />My question is whether 'if' can be used as a replacement for 'whether', as in English.<br /><br />Consider the sentence:<br /><br />'Tell me if you want to live'<br /><br />This could be interpreted as:<br /><br />'Tell me whether you want to live (or not)'<br /><br />or<br /><br />'Tell me! ...and if you don't, you won't live'<br /><br />So my question is - can [b]txo[/b] be used in this same way, or is there another word for 'whether' in Na'vi that we just don't know yet?<br />[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=frommer]<br />You ask a good question. &quot;Whether&quot; is an important word. And your analysis of &quot;Tell me if you want to live&quot;--that is, that it has two distinct meanings--is right on the money.<br /><br />You're right--you can't use &quot;[b]txo[/b]&quot; for all instances of English &quot;whether.&quot;<br /><br />Here are some examples:<br /><br />(1) He asked whether Sally left.<br /><br />That's an indirect question. The direct version, of course, is:<br /><br />(2) He asked, &quot;Did Sally leave?&quot;<br /><br />[BTW, as you probably know, some speakers of non-standard English use similar structures for direct and indirect questions. Those speakers would say, instead of (1),<br /><br />(3) He asked did Sally leave.]<br /><br />Anyway, in Na'vi we only use the direct form. So the sentence becomes:<br /><br />(4) [b]Polawm po san srake Säli holum sìk[/b].<br /><br />And no &quot;whether&quot; is required.<br /><br />As for &quot;Tell me whether you want to live (or not),&quot; there's a different structure:<br /><br />We use &quot;ftxey . . . fuke,&quot; as in:<br /><br />[b]Piveng oer ftxey nga new rivey fuke[/b]. ([b]Fuke [/b]is stressed on the 2nd syllable: [b]fu.[u]KE[/u][/b])<br /><br />&quot;[b]Ftxey[/b],&quot; which is also the verb &quot;choose,&quot; is here a conjunction corresponding to &quot;whether.&quot; And &quot;[b]fuke[/b]&quot; clearly means &quot;or not,&quot; which you can't omit in Na'vi.<br /><br />&quot;[b]Ftxey . . . fuke[/b]&quot; can also be used in direct questions. For &quot;Are you coming?&quot; we usually say:<br /><br />(5) [b]Srake nga za'u?[/b]<br /><br />But there's another version, which corresponds more closely to &quot;Are you coming or not?&quot;<br /><br />(6) [b]Ftxey nga za'u fuke?[/b]<br /><br />Hope that's all clear!<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Deconstructed sentences because I find them useful...<br /><br />[b]Polawm po san srake Säli holum sìk[/b]<br />[b]P&lt;ol&gt;awm po san srake Säli h&lt;ol&gt;um sìk[/b]<br />ask[PERF] 3 quote yes/no Sally leave[PERF] unquote<br />He asked &quot;has Sally left?&quot;<br /><br />[b]Piveng oer ftxey nga new rivey fuke[/b]<br />[b]P&lt;iv&gt;eng oe-r ftxey nga new r&lt;iv&gt;ey fuke[/b]<br />Tell[SUBJ] 1-DAT choose 2 want live[SUBJ] or not<br />Tell me, you choose want to live or not.<br /><br />Will

I don't know about the answer; that would be evident from context. However, case is not optional the way TAM is. Also, providing case in the answer would verify that you heard the question correctly. But certainly in the question, as a practical matter, case would be essential in many contexts: there's a big difference between [i]pesul tamakuk[/i] and [i]pesuti tamakuk[/i], and *pesu tamakuk would be unintelligible. (I take that back: it would most likely be heard as [i]pesut tamakuk[/i], especially if double consonants are reduced the way double vowels are, so if you meant [i]pesul tamakuk[/i] you'd be completely misunderstood.) <br /><br />But y'know how [i]oeng[/i] reverts to [i]oenga-[/i] when declined? I wonder if [i]pesu[/i] would revert to ?[i]pesute[/i] when declined?

I imagine that things which actually are themselves happy, which laugh and dance, are nitram, and things which are enjoyable because they're peaceful are lefpom. Feet aren't either, so it's metaphor, and yeah, nitram would be the right word--for humans, that is. We can't know if either would make sense to the Na'vi. Probably not.

Frommer's said that with &quot;I'm happy&quot;, &quot;I'm cold&quot;, etc., it's [i]oe 'efu ADJ[/i]. The question for me is, how do you say &quot;the wind's cold&quot;?

(Presumably not different adjectives, or F would've made some indication in his gloss.) As for &quot;the wind made me feel coldly&quot;, yeah, as an English speaker I'd understand that to mean emotionally, but we don't know if Na'vi has that metaphor.

<h4>roger</h4>
On one of the posts, s.o. asked what it would mean to use the intentional future with &quot;you&quot;: you intend to go, or I intend you to go? Turns out it's the latter. And they also asked about the scope of the negative. <br /><br />[quote author=Frommer]With the negative added, it's a matter of scope: Is it (a) INTEND [NEG V] or (b) NEG [INTEND V]?<br /><br />So far I've used the det. fut. only as (a). Examples from the video-game dialog:<br /><br />[i]Tafral ke lìsyek oel geyä keye'ugit.[/i]<br />'Therefore I will not heed your insanity.'<br /><br />[i]Ayoe ke wasyem.[/i]<br />'We will not fight.'<br /><br />[i]Ke zasyup lì'Ona ne kxutu a mìfa fu a wrrpa.[/i]<br />'The l'Ona will not perish to the enemy within or the enemy without.'<br />[/quote]<br />[not decided whether (b) should be allowed]<br />[quote]<br />As for the second person examples, the det. fut. without anything else should indicate the intention of the speaker (since you can't get inside someone's head to assess their determination): [i]Ga kasyä[/i] shd. be: I am determined that you will go. (Alternatively, it could be the case that the determinative is only used with the 1st person--but that would eliminate some useful sentences.)*<br /><br />I like your idea of using the evidential with the determinative for the other reading. In the same way, when we use experiential expressions with other than the 1st person, we're implying a &quot;seems&quot; or &quot;appears,&quot; right? So &quot;I'm tired&quot; is straightforward, but &quot;You're tired&quot; is odd unless it means &quot;I perceive you as tired (although I can't be sure if that's true)&quot; or &quot;You seem/appear to be tired.&quot;<br />[/quote]<br /><br />In other words, &quot;You shall not pass!&quot; (the question in the post) would be s.t. like [i]ga ke ftasyem![/i]<br /><br />And if I'm reading this right, it would be ungrammatical (or at least intellectually dishonest) to say [i]ga 'efu geyn[/i] for &quot;you are tired&quot;; one should say instead [i]ga 'efacu geyn[/i]. Similarly, if he decides to go with this, the way to say &quot;you're determined to go&quot; would be [i]ga kasyacä[/i]. (I would assume you could leave out the evidential in either if you're in caheylu!) <br /><br />Capitalization suggests a new prefix in &quot;lì'Ona&quot;, though that might simply be a unitary name. <br /><br />*Is the &quot;lì'Ona&quot; example then actually in 1st person, with the speaker speaking for all, rather than expressing intention for a 3rd party?

Oops, yeah, I shouldn't have used [i]ngeyn[/i]; I was just translating F's examples. <br /><br />I would imagine that if you were to use &lt;ats&gt; in zup, you'd be saying that it appears that you intend, rather than just that you intend. Normally we're aware of our own intentions. <br /><br />The idea is that I can say that I am tired, because I know how I feel. I can ask you if you are tired, because you know how you feel. But it makes no more sense for me to tell you that you are tired, than it does to ask you if I am tired. We have this in English: &quot;You look tired. Why don't you lie down?&quot; It would be rather odd to tell s.o. &quot;You're tired. Go lie down.&quot; The &quot;look&quot; would be translated with &lt;ats&gt;. The question then would be if its grammatically or culturally acceptable to say &quot;S/he's tired&quot;, or if we're required to say &quot;S/he looks tired&quot; with the &lt;ats&gt;. (Unless maybe it's our horse we're talking about, and we're in tsaheylu, so we know first-hand that s/he's tired.)

I've actually been trying to keep on top of adding things to my google docs spreadsheet as new words come out, but that's not so much with a goal of being a dictionary, but more a goal of being a reference to pronunciation.

[quote author=HTML_Earth link=topic=7265.msg160551#msg160551 date=1269712227]<br />I made a picture with all of the words on it, for simple learning! :D<br />[url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/mgallery/?sa=item;id=409]http://forum.learnnavi.org/mgallery/?sa=item;id=409[/url]<br />[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Paul Frommer via e-mail]...the re'o chart is wonderful--[desc=translation by Prrton -- it brought many smiles to my 2 lips. -- *it* and *my* are implied by the context.]aylrrtokit apxay ne meseyri zamolunge![/desc][/quote]<br /><br />It seems important to call out the numbers of eyes, ears, lips, etc. when we talk about our body parts (or the Na'vi body parts) &quot;generically&quot; when first establishing the number (or if something else does not establish the number). Once established, then the singular forms can be used if that doesn't create some kind of ambiguity.<br /><br />This chart is clearly a hit (at least with me and K. Pawl, but I know with others too), so in the future, you may want to help people learn their plurals better and become accustomed to THINKING this way at the same time by including the numbers of 'parts' when labeling them. You might want to do that in parentheses or using some other annotation. The most important thing is the base word/name for the body part, but referring to it *natively* is also a factor in fluency.<br /><br />- menari<br />- meseyri<br />- memikyun<br />- sanhì (short (lenited) plural) of tanhì)...<br /><br />In English we only call out the numbers (two lips) for special emphasis, but in Na'vi the numbers (up to a count of 3 of something) are built in to all plurals. And the number of eyes on a Na'vi is different than the number commonly found on the 'beasts'.<br /><br />Make sense? It's just a suggestion to think about. &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Irayo nìmun!

I learned a new word from NPR today, [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon]hapax legomenon[/url] -- a word that occurs only once in a given corpus.&nbsp; Although in the NPR story it was being used to refer to phrases that occur in only one use in a language, so i don't know if that fits the &quot;official&quot; definition--they gave the example of the phrase &quot;under God&quot; being an archaic way of saying &quot;God-willing&quot; that is now extant (at least in American English) only in our Pledge of Allegiance.<br /><br />So, i would like to know if Karyu Pawl has any examples of 1) a word that is used in Na'vi for only one phrase and/or 2) a phrase in Na'vi that only exists to be used in one very specific context (e.g., a phrase one would only use while communing with the Tree of Souls, used for no other purpose).<br /><br />Don't ask me why i would want these things; i just...do.<br /><br />If you feel this doesn't belong in this thread, ma smuk, please let me know, and i'll relocate it.

<h4>Tiger</h4>
That is the sort of thing I refer to as &quot;Linguistic lense flare&quot; - making an analogy to the quintessential 3-d animation effect of a lense flare...&nbsp; Something that in real optics is undesirable and every attempt is made to minimize, yet when there is a chance to not have it at all, it is added in artistically (Hopefully artistically, anyway) to make it feel more organic and real because we are used to seeing it.&nbsp; With constructed languages you could avoid all these irregularities, archaic forms, and other such things that make the language difficult to learn or use, but putting them in makes the language feel more natural and more real.<br /><br />So, it's a fair question.&nbsp; Don't expect an answer right away, but asking it may be enough to put the thought in his mind, and perhaps down the road something like that will appear.

At least, a way to describe color in reference to something else.<br /><br />BTW, I did see 'Avatar' again a couple weeks back. Paid a lot of attention to colors. An amazing amount of cyan-- Ikrans, bioluminescence, etc. Perhaps, this is where the idea for [b]ean[/b] meaning 'blue or green' came from-- cyan is an additive mix of blue and green. (Third bar from left in TV color bars.) There was a fair amount of magenta, the other 'odd' additive color (fifth bar from left in TV color bars), especially in bioluminescence. Not as much green as I would have thought-- scenes that should have had a lot of green were often dark scenes, deep in the forest (Green showed up OK in well-lit scenes). Purples were seen in bioluminescence, often along with magenta and some reds. Of course, you had the deep blue of Na`vi skin. Didn't notice a lot of yellows. There was the striking reds and oranges of Toruk. And a little blood (which was minimized for ratings reasons) Otherwise, these color were uncommon in the Na`vi world.<br /><br />As far as Na`vi color perception range goes, there were indeed some 'first person' scenes of Jake looking out through his avatar. The color range in those views was the same color range that we would see. That implies that the Na`vi see color the same way we do, even if they can't explain what (for instance) 'red' is without a reference.

Her tail is flicking back and forth in a highly controlled pattern of an undulating S-curve. She is not saying anything, but it is clear to everyone involved that she is furious. Even the guy is watching her tail (out of the corners of his menari) as it appears to the left and right of her body. He's evaluating her tail as much as her face to figure out if he's making any progress, but trying not to let her know this, because it's considered rude). One of the onlookers comments: [b]&quot;Well, that's one mad tail. I think he's 'spending the night with the nantang'.&quot;[/b] She, of course, is using her tail to utterly subjugate him, because at another level of social complexity she is also aware of the corners of his eyes and those of the passive onlookers. Without saying a single word to anyone other than to him about &quot;what happened&quot; (ever), she can create a firestorm of gossip that will socially shame him into making much &quot;better choices&quot; about whom he strolls by the river with &quot;next time.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]&quot;calm tail&quot;[/b] «*maweya kxetse» / «kxetse nìmawey»<br /><br />Basically the opposite of &quot;mad tail&quot;.

Not the most adorable syllable in the world IMHO ([desc=ìlä safya a fpìl oe]ÌSAFO[/desc]).<br /><br />I love this kind of speculation, but guess that many might be uncomfortable with certain aspects of it, because at some point(s) it begins to assign values that may not be Cameronian.<br /><br />So that's the long answer. The short answer is [b]I've never explicitly discussed an idiomatic phrase/maxim with K. Pawl[/b] that was specific to Na'vi culture in the sense of your ikran relationship.

<h2>Re: Idiomatic Expressions</h2>
<h4>`Eylan Ayfalulukanä</h4>
Now you've got me going! ;D<br /><br />I can kind of see why Frommer liked the Ikran expression that Taronyu used. My head is now spinning, trying to come up with some more similar expressions (almost slogans, really), but concerning ayfalulukan. (There have already been a couple about aynantang, one mentioned in this thread).<br /><br />And speaking of tails, and what they communicate, I fondly remember my liger friend Hobbs doing something very interesting with his tail (which had a tassel on it, like lions and Na`vi). When we would just be sitting together, he would often be deep in thought (what do ligers think about, anyway?) The tip of the tail would be moving around kind of randomly. Every now and then, he would thump the ground with it. I have seen other cats do this, including domestics, but not to the extent Hobbs did it. So from this, I came up with the phrase 'thinking with the tail', which is what I told people he was doing when they observed this. So since we have seen the tail used to (perhaps involuntarily) express emotions, why not [b]fperil fa kxtse[/b]? I could see this happening when everyone is seated around the fire in the evening.

It's quite formulaic though.&nbsp; If it's a stressed syllable that an infix is merging with, the infix gets dropped.<br /><br />So FRRfen + er = FRRfen while pllTXE + ol = polTXE.<br /><br />Hypothetically if the stress of frrfen were on the second syllable it would be frrFEN + er = ferFEN.&nbsp; Quite predictable.

Mantis is cool. I wonder if it has the greek sense as well - eh, annis?<br /><br />As for birds - I thought we were fairly certain that there are no birds on Pandora. Does PF know something that we don't?

[u]Verb Form[/u]<br /><br />Are we correctly hearing &quot;tspìmìyang&quot; in the movie for &quot;I was about to kill him?&quot;&nbsp; If so, can any past infix be used in the first slot, &quot;tspalmìyang, tspamìyang&quot;?&nbsp; Any future form in the second?&nbsp; It seems like any aspect or mood marking would be restricted to one slot or the other.&nbsp; In the context of the rest of the Na'vi verb system something like *tspìyìmang doesn't seem to make sense — but does this have some meaning?

Wow, I missed pa'o in my compiling a list of words, don't know how that happened.&nbsp; Using la- as a general prefix isn't really attested at this point.&nbsp; The &quot;correct&quot; way would be &quot;trr alahe&quot;, but then again it's a common enough expression that it wouldn't be surprising for a shortened form to appear even if la- isn't a general prefix.

[size=12pt][font=Garamond]Apart from &quot;the other day&quot; being an idiomatic expression, if I'm not mistaken.

See my comment about &quot;He is under the tree&quot;.&nbsp; In cases where it's not just a simple locative &quot;at&quot;, it is unclear if there is a difference between lu and tok.&nbsp; (And even when it is &quot;at&quot;, what about &quot;lu ro X rather than tok?)&nbsp; Though I'd think &quot;lu&quot; would be more in the sense of &quot;Lu sanhì mì taw&quot; - stars exist in the sky...&nbsp; The existance just is there, it's not like the stars would be anywhere else in that case.&nbsp; Whereas a person who climbed a tree would be &quot;Tute mì utral tok&quot; - that is where their location right now, not their place of existance.&nbsp; But maybe that's splitting hairs a bit too fine.

And more or less with roger's last musing...<br /><br />I believe and (try to) use LU and TOK per the following:<br /><br />LU covers the English semantic range for [b]there is/are[/b] and [b]to be (a noun or an adjective)[/b]<br />TOK covers the English semantic range for [b]to be located at/in/on a place taking up space.[/b]<br /><br />LU covers the Spanish semantic range for HAY and SER<br />TOK covers the Spanish semantic range for ESTAR<br /><br />LU covers the Mandarin semantic range for 要 (you) and 是 (shi) (basically the same as Spanish)<br />TOK cover the Mandarin semantic range for 在 (zai) (basically the same as Spanish)<br /><br />LU covers the Thai semantic range for MII and BPEN (basically the same as Spanish and Mandarin)<br />TOK covers the Thai semantic range for YUU (basically the same as Spanish)<br /><br />I hope this won't hurt sales, but...<br /><br />When the &quot;oe [b]lu[/b] hu skxawng&quot; shirt first appeared (or I should say when I saw it advertised, maybe a day later) I dashed off a mail to Seabass pointing out that TO ME it reads &quot;I am (in a serious (likely mated pair) relationship) with the adjacent moron.&quot; I suggested that if the point were to stand by a buddy in a bar and laugh about it, the text would more SAFELY read &quot;oe [b]tok[/b] hu skxawng&quot; (meaning &quot;I happen to be here ((now) physically present and taking up space (hanging out on a man date)) with the adjacent moron.&quot;<br /><br />Apparently, it had already &quot;gone to press.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway. This is how I see it:<br /><br />Oeru [b]LU[/b] eylan apxay. [b]LU[/b] suteo a [b]TOK[/b] mì Yu.E.Sey ulte [b]LU[/b] 'ewana aynumeyu, ulte kop (LU) suteo alahe a [b]TOK[/b] mì frakllpxìltu kifkeyka ulte ke [b]LU[/b] 'ewan nìwotx.<br /><br />[b]THERE ARE[/b] many friends to me (= I have many friends).

I do think that it is for PEOPLE/THINGS that are physically taking up space at a stated location [optionally: (for a limited/specific scope of time)].<br /><br />I feel we'll need LOTS of negative examples (Rä'ä tsat txula nìfìfya a sìkenong) from K. Pawl to grasp this completely (and there [b]could[/b] be a rather big gray area) unlike Spanish in which things are pretty clearly right and wrong when it comes to SER vs. ESTAR.<br /><br />PS: in the example above the VERB in the English ends up being artificially over-repeated to show the relationship to the Na'vi, but cause in Na'vi it gets stated over and over again because it changes back and forth from LU to TOK to LU again...

I thought about &quot;Tutel tok tsenget a mì utral&quot; which, besides being a bit clumsy, would really be a short form of &quot;Tutel tok tsenget a lu mì utral&quot; - which then uses &quot;lu&quot; to avoid using &quot;lu&quot;.&nbsp; But yes, definitely a question to ask.&nbsp; Probably rather high priority as well considering how common of a thing it is to say that you are near/in/under/on/etc a place.<br /><br />But if &quot;lu&quot; + adp can be used, then why have &quot;tok&quot; at all if you could just say &quot;lu ro&quot;?

@Tigermind: I mean probable: you're right. I also assume that mowan and vä' are opposites - I think that vä' would hold the english definition &quot;noisome&quot;.

I fixed some of the things, notably la-, which I like, but people don't want to stand behind, yet, jsut as fay+, I think. I didn't change lu + adp., because I didn't mean physical existence, but rather the time when I was enrolled, at which I didn't have to actually be in the school. I think that this works fine. I fixed some of the other errors - I hadn't realised latem was intransitive. You're right, none of us are 100%. I don't think I'm as bad as you think I am with grammar, though.

Not as much green as I would have thought-- scenes that should have had a lot of green were often dark scenes, deep in the forest (Green showed up OK in well-lit scenes).

Precisely because there is so much in the blue-green range, it may well be more practical to say &quot;X-colored&quot; than to have different abstract words. That's how orange, pink, purple, violet, etc. arose quite recently in English. But red or yellow would stand out in the forest and so would be more salient. They'd also be more likely to be culturally salient with red and yellow items used as decoration and jewelry. But who would have blue jewelry? (Though of course not all Na'vi live in the forest--we keep talking about the colors of the forest rather than the plains or mountains, but all those people speak the same language.) <br /><br />Large color-term inventories like those of English and Russian only arose with the development of manufacturing and the dyes needed for cloth and paint.

A Na'vi tribe from a mountainous region may have the word for &quot;gray&quot; in their vocabulary set, for all the rocks around them. But a Na'vi tribe from the lush forests would almost never see this color, and so may not have a need to give it a specific name.<br /><br />Also, on the topic of naming things influenced by their commonality, I think it would be much more likely that things that are common to a Na'vi tribe would have names, whereas things that are rarely seen would escape being named, and would be talked about in reference to other things (defined by comparison, that is). Therefore, I agree with Mirri that the Na'vi would have several names for shades of blue that we might not have.<br /><br />One more thing to add. &quot;ean&quot; is blue/green, as we know. In Japanese, the word &quot;ao&quot; is also blue/green. For the Japanese, &quot;ao&quot; refers not to blue [i]or[/i] green, but to a color that could be seen as blueish green, or greenish blue. So, maybe the Na'vi word &quot;ean&quot; also refers to the before mentioned cyan, a color which holds both blue and green properties, and is also very common in the forest depicted in the movie.

Also, AFAIK, in every language that has a single color term &quot;grue&quot; (green/blue), it is not cyan but either blue or green. That is, if you ask people to pick the &quot;best&quot; grue in a color wheel, they'll pick either a prototypical blue or a prototypical green, not something in-between. So we really can call it either blue or green. If you ask about the other color, they'll say that green is a kind of blue, or vice versa that blue is a kind of green, just as in most languages people would say that pink is a light shade of red and that orange is a kind of yellow.

Thus, I agree with Omängum Fra'uti with a couple minor differences.<br /><br />Omängum Fra'uti first lists red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet-- the spectral colors we are all taught. These are light colors, and therefore additive. I think that indigo is too close to either blue or violet, and was probably added to make 'Roy G. Biv' work. So lets discard it. Now you have red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. This contains the additive and subtractive primary colors, and many of the secondaries. He suggested cyan, which is a pretty essential color on Pandora, as has been previously discussed. Then, with just the addition of magenta, you have all the primary and all the secondary colors for both additive light) and subtractive (non-light) colors. Thus so far, red, orange, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, blue, violet-- 8 very basic colors. Now, you add brown,&nbsp; as Omängum Fra'uti suggests. This gives you a color that represents mixed subtractive colors, and is a common color in the natural world-- soils, wood, bark, dried vegetation, etc. Lastly, add black, gray and white. We already have black and white, so all that is needed is gray. So in total, you would have red, orange, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, blue, violet, brown, black, gray and white-- 12 terms that can be used to describe just about any color to adegree that the other party would understand. (Remember, you cannot describe a basic color in terms of another basic color, especially the primary colors.) The only thing one might need in addition to this is a modifier for dark and light shades. As I see it, this is the 'balance' between having 1 or 2 overly broad words for color, and a huge number of terms, like 'puce', 'putty', 'sandstone', etc.<br /><br />As a television engineer, color is really important to me. More than you would think goes into making sure a TV camera faithfully reproduces the colors it is shooting. Engineers spend hours arguing over how to properly portray a color, and as a result, quite a number of standards for color are currently in use. Since a TV camera cannot exactly mimic the eye, you have to accept tradeoffs to cover a useful range of colors, without the camera generating colors that are not really there.<br /><br /><br />The wikipedia article on brown is actually rather interesting.<br />[/quote]

Likewise he regarded wine, the sea, and sheep as all being the same color &quot;purply red&quot;.<br /><br />Aristotle identified seven shades of color, all of which he thought derived from black and white, but these were really grades of brightness, not color.<br /><br />In the wake of Darwin it was postulated that the early Greeks' retinas had not evolved the ability to perceive colors, but it is now thought that they simply grouped objects in terms of qualities other than color, so that a word which seems to indicate &quot;yellow&quot; or &quot;light green&quot; really means fluid, fresh and living, and so was appropriately used to describe blood, the human sap.<br /><br />There are more languages in Papua New Guinea than anywhere else in the world but, apart from distinguishing between light and dark, many of them have no other words for color at all.<br /><br />Classical Welsh has no words for &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;grey&quot;, &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;green&quot;. Their color spectrum was divided differently. One word &quot;glas&quot; covered part of green; another word the rest of green, the whole of blue and part of grey; a third word the rest of grey and most of brown. Modern Welsh now uses the word &quot;glas&quot; to mean blue.<br /><br />Russian has no single word for &quot;blue&quot;, it has two &quot;goluboi&quot; and &quot;sinii&quot;, usually translated as &quot;light blue&quot; and &quot;dark blue&quot;, but to Russians they are distinct, different colors, not different shades of the same color.<br /><br />All languages develop their color terms in the same way. After black and white, the third color to be named is always red, the fourth and fifth are green and yellow (in either order), the sixth is blue and the seventh brown. Welsh still doesn't have a word for brown.<br />[/td][/tr][/table]<br /><br />What strikes me as interesting is that these languages did not see light as having a color. All the color words have to do with paint or surfaces (objects).<br />I can imagine it wasn't until the invention of televisions that we needed to know light could have different colors.<br />Even stained glass windows on churches would be considered paint, because it really was just a thin layer of paint that made the light change color.<br /><br />In addition to the colors, English has words like &quot;gloss&quot;, &quot;satin&quot; and &quot;matte&quot; to describe reflective qualities of light (texture). There's also funky stuff like [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearlescent_coatings]pearlescent[/url] and [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescent]iridescent[/url] and opalescent and metallic and other ways of 'displaying' colors.<br /><br />There's also shades of each color. English has &quot;light&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; and &quot;pastel&quot; (pale), for instance.<br /><br />Even the modern discussion of what color is gets more muddy when you try to define it, for instance in my digital art programs there's five different ways of defining a color. Some use hues and saturations, others RGB or CMYK. Some are palettes, some are mixers, some are gradients.<br />All these traditional methods of defining color all depend on whether you're trying to make digital art, print, paint, ink, etc.<br /><br />Add to this the fact that the human eye perceives color as contrasts to the colors surrounding it, rather than an absolute value (nicely demonstrated by the [url=http://www.opticalillusions.net/userpics/37200945503PMchessboard-illusion.jpg]chessboard optical illusion[/url]) and it all gets really confusing!

<h2 id="76">Ke... kaw'it.</h2>
<h4>Prrton</h4>
For the phrase:<br /><br />I have many friends. There are some who are in the USA and are young students, and also some others who are in all other territories of the world who are not young at all.<br /><br />K. Pawl gave this in Na'vi:<br /><br />[quote=Paul Frommer:]Oeru lu eylan apxay. Lu suteo a tok Yu.E.Seyti ulte lu 'ewana aynumeyu, ulte kop suteo alahe a tok frakllpxìltut kifkeyä ulte ke lu 'ewan kaw'it.<br /><br />[ke . . . kaw'it: 'not . . . at all']<br /><br />(Note, by the way, that the stress in {kaw'it} is on the second syllable: kaw'IT.)<br /><br />[/quote]<br /><br />The main reason I'm posting this is to show the new way to say &quot;NO.... AT ALL&quot; but here is a way to contrast LU with TOK and see the accusative impact of TOK on the PLACE that TOK references. Note that in simple sentences the subject of TOK («sute.o») would also take the ergative case («-l»), but here all of the grammar related to TOK is happening in clauses, so the role of «sute.o» in the bigger picture of the sentence (OUTSIDE of the clauses) drives the case marking.<br /><br />to-me [b]THERE ARE [color=blue](LU)[/color][/b] friends (short plural of 'eylan) many. [b]THERE ARE [color=blue](LU)[/color][/b] some-people (short plural of tute+o (indefinite marker) who [b]ARE-IN/OCCUPY [color=brown](TOK)[/color][/b] the USA-[size=8pt][color=brown][b]ACC[/b][/color][/size] and [b]ARE [color=blue](LU)[/color][/b] young learners, and also some-people others who [b]ARE-IN/OCCUPY [color=brown](TOK)[/color][/b] all-territories-[size=8pt][color=brown][b]ACC[/b][/color][/size] of-the-world and [color=green][b]NOT[/b][/color] [b]ARE [color=blue](LU)[/b][/color] young [color=green][b]AT ALL[/b][/color].<br /><br />The second example for which he particularly liked the feeling of the idiomatic translation is:<br /><br /> &nbsp; POAN pak!? [b][color=green]KE[/color][/b] lu po tsamsiyu [b][color=green]kaw'IT[/color][/b]!<br /><br /> &nbsp; HIM!? There's not a warrior's bone in his whole body!<br /><br />So it can be used to add emphasis with any phrases that uses KE+LU to form a negatively framed description of something/someone. It could also be used with an adjective of negative meaning to say something very NICE.

<h2>Re: Ke... kaw'it.</h2>
<h4>Ean Tirea</h4>
well imo, &quot;ke.....kaw'it&quot; LITERALLY means &quot;not.......,not-one-bit&quot;<br /><br />I would expect that we could use this construction the same we do in English, since its meaning is pretty much exactly the same as our &quot;not one bit&quot;<br /><br />but of course, &quot;not one bit&quot; DOES very well seem to much better fit &quot;noun ke lu adj kaw'it&quot; and &quot;noun ke lu noun kaw'it&quot; constructions than &quot;noun ke verb kaw'it&quot; <br /><br />It just seemed to me that ke and kaw'it are adverbs, so maybe they could work on all verbs?:<br /><br />He walks. (sraight and simple.)<br /><br />He walks not. (how does he walk? NOT. he doesn't walk.)<br /><br />He walks not one bit. (how does he walk? not one bit. he definately does not walk.)<br /><br />this is what an adverb does, and I have a hunch that ke kaw'it should work on all verbs.<br /><br />but seeing as how many places Na'vi is different from English, I have no solid ground to stand on here.

If you were taking it as a verb on it's own, then &quot;kxeyey&quot; would be the subject and it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense, let alone mean what you translated it as.&nbsp; It is fulfilling its role as an auxiliary verb there based off kxeyey.

Right, but Frommer has said that only direct speech is allowed.<br /><br />[quote=Paul Frommer]<br />Suppose the sentence is, &quot;Eytukan said he would go, but I don't believe him.&quot; <br /><br />Everything converts to direct speech, so it would be: <br /><br />Poltxe Eytukan san oe kayä sìk, slä oel pot ke spaw.<br /><br />[quote=roger]And it looks like only direct speech is allowed?[/quote]<br />Right<br />[/quote]

Perhaps he means that if you have san...sìk it's some type of relayed spoken quote (direct or indirect) and no san...sìk means it must be a statement?<br /><br />Frommer's sentence makes a bit more sense to me this way if I translate peng as &quot;inform&quot;

The fact that he took an indirect quote and said about it &quot;Everything converts to direct speech&quot; seems to imply it is not just if san...sìk is used, but the nature of how things are said.

That's not an absolute.&nbsp; There are plenty of words that aren't syllabified like that.&nbsp; And compound words USUALLY keep their syllabification.&nbsp; (I'm sure there's others, but &quot;[u]tut[/u]an&quot; is one notable exception, but that's because the second syllable of &quot;tute&quot; is sort of &quot;lost&quot;.)<br /><br />Some words not syllabified as CVCV...<br />[u]'eng[/u]eng<br />[u]'i'[/u]a (That's how it is normally, so no reason to think a prefix and suffix would change a syllable boundary they don't even touch)<br />[u]tut[/u]an<br />kur[u]akx[/u]<br />[u]kxang[/u]angang<br /><br />And diphthongs can go either way...<br />[u]few[/u]i<br />[u]'e[/u]wan<br /><br />

It also seems fine to me for the Na'vi to have more colors than their &quot;level of civilization&quot; might predict in comparison to cultures in the Amazon, PNG, etc., even if those (like ours) reference things in their environments. Certainly we had no &quot;neon&quot; colors until we had neon. No &quot;fluorescent&quot; colors until we had technology that was capable of fluorescing.

William moved it, and I trust he had a reason so I see no reason to second guess that.&nbsp; It may be merely because the LEP is about a specific request for words, not idioms/phrases.&nbsp; It is also (Prrton creations aside) asking Frommer to create the words, whereas this is suggesting things for acceptance/suggestions.

Nì'eyng is actually in the dictionary.&nbsp; The translation would be something like &quot;When I receive a message in Na'vi, I want to write the same way in response.&quot;&nbsp; The correction was just a slight semantic correction to something else in the email, nothing grammatical or such.&nbsp; (Specifically it was using 'u where the more specific kem worked better.)<br /><br />As far as sample sentences, I'm actually working on a website (very slowly) with the intent of cataloging example usage of words, both Frommerian or otherwise.&nbsp; The main idea I have is to include pronunciation, but the core concept is similar to what EanaEltu does, except more correct and saving sentences with references to used words.&nbsp; So you can look up a word and then ask for sample sentences which use it, including derived and inflected forms.&nbsp; But it will probably be awhile until I am at that stage.

Yes, of course. If something (countable) can be «PXAY» it can also be «FRA-»...? Makes sense. Very compatible with &quot;every&quot; too.<br /><br />Now here's something to think about...<br /><br />In English, &quot;[url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss]moss[/url]&quot; (singular) is a collective noun that references &quot;all moss&quot;. Moss is not countable unless you add a &quot;grouping&quot; word to it like &quot;patch.&quot; (e.g. &quot;There are 3 patches of moss on the stone wall beside my house.&quot;) There are roughly 12,000 known species of moss. Whenever one uses the plural &quot;3 mosses&quot; the meaning automatically becomes &quot;3 [species/kinds] of moss&quot;.<br /><br />Three patches of moss could contain only one moss or 17 mosses.<br /><br />I'm curious if any other languages do this and if there are any other good examples even in English!? &quot;Food&quot; comes to mind. That's probably why I got such a cognitive dissonance when I added FRA- to SYUVE.<br /><br />Anybody know?<br /><br />What do «pxefay, mesyuve &amp; frrwll» mean in Na'vi?<br /><br />AND, now that I'm on a roll...<br /><br />Pardon the technical term, but to DE-COUNT-ABL-IFY (generalize) countable nouns in English and talk about them collectively, we add &quot;THẼ&quot; sometimes with a funny overemphasized pronunciation (noted here by the funny diacritic.) &quot;THẼ HOUSE stands at the core of mainstream American aspirations.&quot; That means essentially that &quot;all houses&quot; (generically referred to as ONE) in America stand...<br /><br />&nbsp; - THẼ GUN is a huge bone of contention.<br /><br />Japanese (which has *almost* no plurals to speak of to start with) basically topicalizes the noun and if the sense of the English THẼ is very strong it also gets &quot;to yū no&quot; in front of the topicalizing &quot;wa&quot; which in the case of THẼ GUN would work out to be something à la &quot;as for that which is said 'gun'&quot;.<br /><br />(And as we might in English if we were not being to snooty about it,) Spanish would just use the plural, ¿no?<br /><br />It seems to me in Na'vi that -ìRI/-RI would come into play, but since Na'vi DOES have plurals and DOESN'T have a definite (or hyper-definite???... hmm... I'm beginning to smell THẼ FRA-...) article, I wonder what would happen (if anything) to the rest of it.<br /><br />«Kelkuri frapor tsranten nìtxan» leaves me a bit confused and questioning... but not completely lost...

I won't quote you, [i]pänutìng oe[/i]. Specifically about your etymology, though, words that appear like other roots, most likely, are not. I am sure that you know that. I just think that it should be said. Specifically, what I mean by saying that, is that that Frommer will indicate what a homonym in English will mean in Na'vi. &quot;Snumìna: dim [i](of a person)[/i],&quot; for instance. Basically, if otherwise NOT indicated, the meaning that we receive for any word is the one that we most utilize in our day to day.

[quote]<br />...Frommer will indicate what a homonym in English will mean in Na'vi. &quot;Snumìna: dim [i](of a person)[/i],&quot; for instance. Basically, if otherwise NOT indicated, the meaning that we receive for any word is the one that we most utilize in our day to day.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Of course. But, in some cases, like the BROADER meaning of &quot;harmonious&quot; (which was the theme on which I was commenting), the [b]themes/meanings[/b] that we as [b]individuals[/b] most assign and [b]utilize in our day to day lives[/b] can be context sensitive. I'm not very musically inclined. I don't play instruments or perform musically (though I love to dance and have &quot;rhythm&quot;). So, if someone asks me to associate &quot;harmony/harmonious&quot; with a meaning or context, the first thing that pops into my head is &quot;peace and harmony&quot; (i.e. &quot;people getting along with each other well&quot;). That sense of &quot;harmony&quot; is essentially the same as musical harmony at its core (people vs. notes/chords getting along well together) but the way to express that [b]could be[/b] very different in Na'vi. Example:<br /><br />&nbsp; [i][b]way[/b][/i] vs. [i][b]tìrol[/b][/i]<br /><br />&nbsp; Both are given as &quot;song&quot; (n.).<br /><br />I assume that [i]nangtang[/i] are not capable of the verb [i][b]rol[/b][/i] (&quot;to sing&quot; (possibly because it involves lyrics (?))) but [i]ngu[i]way[/i][/i] (&quot;pack howling/calls&quot; (cf: &quot;birdsong&quot;)) is clearly their &quot;song&quot; domain. That doesn't mean to me that the Na'vi ([i]tute[/i]) are not capable of [i][b]way[/b][/i] (instrumental?, humming?), but there could still be a great deal of subtlety in how [i][b]way[/b][/i] is distinguished (or not) from [b][i]tìrol[/i][/b] in different contexts.<br /><br />&nbsp; That's a nice [______]:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - song<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - tune<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - ditty<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - melody<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - track<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - warbling<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - chirping<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - cheeping<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - peeping<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Twitter® (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - moan (of whale song)<br /><br />I wish I knew how K. Pawl would translate &quot;the First Songs&quot; (from Neytiri's line from the film (for more reasons than one)). [i]Ayway/Sìrol[/i]? There could be a lot of meaning/distinction there. [i]Pxeway/Pxesìrol[/i]? The &quot;First Songs&quot; might be a set of only three? Or there might exist unknown to us at this time a term or terms that *sound/feel* more like our names for &quot;aria, ballad, canticle&quot; that the Na'vi use to refer ONLY to those &quot;Songs&quot;. If someone can, please [fill me in]/[tell me]/[inform me]/[let me know]/[enlighten me]/[share that with me].<br /><br />I don't think we should automatically assume that words that are NOT explicitly marked as RESTRICTED in context by K. Pawl carry [b]precisely[/b] the same (English) semantic ranges (and/or biases) as the words that are used in the definitions. As thorough as he is, there is still, from time to time, the potential for ambiguity. Most are minor and relatively unimportant in recent days, but there was a LONG stretch a while back when we didn't know if &quot;light&quot; ([i]atan[/i]) was &quot;illumination&quot;(n.) or &quot;not heavy&quot;(adj.). That ambiguity was none of K. Pawl's doing, of course, but those of us who struggled so in the &quot;early days&quot; are still sensitive to the possibility of more serious uncertainty, so we think about it. And, we have to be prepared to be wrong and relearn. That's quite palatable for me and a big part of my personal journey with Na'vi.<br />

[b]keltsun[/b] surprises me a little; i would have expected *ketsun--but, then again, that would get confused with [b]ke tsun[/b], i guess.&nbsp; <br /><br />I like [b]kxuke[/b] (&quot;no harm&quot;), especially because it contrasts nicely with [b]zawnong[/b], whereas in English we generally use the same word for both concepts.<br /><br />I'm a little surprised, though, at how many words are derived from affixing some variation of ke to their opposites—e.g., [b]kerusey[/b] = &quot;not living&quot; (dead); [b]keteng[/b] = &quot;not same&quot; (different); keyawr = &quot;not correct&quot; (wrong).&nbsp; I would have expected all of these to be important enough to have their own words, rather than being derived this way.<br /><br />[b]Slä oeri ke lu ngopyu lì'fyayä leNa'vi, tafral tìftxey ke lu oeru.[/b]<br />But i am not the creator of the Na'vi language, therefore the choice is not mine.

Tewti!

Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and agree with Mithcoriel here.&nbsp; You're using it as a preposition, but in Na'vi it does not work that way.&nbsp; I think &quot;mungwrr&quot; would fill the role you are trying to use it as.&nbsp; Also, the reflexive doesn't work there either.&nbsp; That comes out as &quot;We create us&quot; - as in we are creating ourselves, not creating something for ourselves.

We have no way to verify the existence of either ([i]luke tsaheylu[/i]), so death is a really big deal for (some of) us.<br /><br />I still want to know if the Na'vi typically go through a download process ([i]fa tsaheylu[/i]) before 'death' (and if Tsu'tey's and Eytukan's experience of death without that opportunity somehow means that their spirits are LESS represented with the rest of the [i]fizayu[/i] with/within Eywa). That would be very sad (&quot;very sad only&quot;), but possibly in keeping with the biologically based aspects of their 'religion' that we have seen. In general, the societies in which I've lived my life so far (South Carolina, Hawai'i, Metropolitan Tokyo, Northern California) think of &quot;life&quot; as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;death&quot; as &quot;bad&quot;.

(or the RDA forces nìteng??). That might be very distinct from Grace's experience of *«terkup fte kivä/ftivem nìkerusey» (This is a great example of my breaking the rule/admonition that I just posted above, BTW. We have no concrete idea of what *nìkerusey might actually mean (to K.

@Prrton (and everyone, in general)<br /><br />Sorry if this is a little beyond the topic, overall. Like I've uttered before, the reach of Eywa over Eywa'eveng is total. She is all of it. More substantial a point here than the Na'vi and their connection with Eywa, is the nature of Eywa &quot;her&quot;self. Is She a singularity of consciousness within Pandora or as large as the planet, itself? If she is the planet, I feel that it is the next LOGICAL step to assume that Her mind, like aether, permeates all aspects of Pandora. [i]Ayvitra Na'viä[/i] are but Her, in more coalesced forms, both in Mind and body. Long story short, when the Na'vi die, the body falls away and the &quot;stuff&quot; inside just becomes one with what is there. If they use the queue, that's likened to the tunnel many see during the dying process.<br /><br />The Na'vi concept of death is obviously not like that of the West. For me, the Na'vi people realize death as it is in its purest, the removal of Self from a body and the regrettable end of all connections It made while in life. That aspect's what [i]we[/i] mourn, most of all - that someone is &quot;gone,&quot; never to be connected with again. Sure, via their connection to their ancestors, the Na'vi don't have that, but [b]kxitx[/b] still proves tragic...

<h2>Re: ayoeru mipa aylì'u nì'ul lu, tewti!</h2>
<h4>`Eylan Ayfalulukanä</h4>
I think its a good thing that there is finally a unique (and very interesting) word for 'death'.<br /><br />Assuming for the moment that the Na`vi are indeed like us in the sense they have body and spirit, a mechanism MUST exist to 'collect' spirits that die without a physical tsaheylu occurring. It may be that via tsaheylu is the 'peaceful' way to die and be collected by Eywa. But if tsaheylu doesn't happen, Eywa collects the soul through another means. This strongly implies that there is MUCH more to Eywa than we understand. I bet Eywa would continue to 'exist' even if all life on Pandora was obliterated. But this is best discussed elsewhere on this forum.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I don't believe in Eywa, but I believe strongly that Eywa/Gaia is a very valid and functional concept.

<h2 id="83">ayyerik</h2>
<h4>roger</h4>
Asked about the plural of [i]yerik[/i]. Sounds as though geminate consonants are not phonetically distinctive, but that he prefers to preserve them in the orthography. <br /><br />[quote author=Frommer]I've gone back and forth on that one, but I ultimately decided on [i]ayyerik[/i]. I don't think the distinction has much consequence for the spoken language--ayyerik and ayerik would sound pretty much the same--so it's really a matter of spelling conventions. I prefer [i]ayyerik [/i]because it clearly identifies the plural marker--cf. (1) [i]ayyerik ayawne[/i], and (2) [i]ayerik ayawne[/i]. (2) would be harder on readers--in the first word, they'd have to recognize the [i]a [/i]as a truncated plural marker, while in the second, it's the &quot;modifier [i]a[/i].&quot; So I prefer (1).[/quote]<br /><br />I assume then that [i]ayyerik[/i] would be pronounced [a.ye.rik] rather than [ay.ye.rik] or [ay.e.rik], but that's just a guess.

I'm not clear on that. He appears to be saying that it doesn't really make any difference, whereas in languages such as Arabic which contrast y and yy this makes a huge difference, implying that there isn't a phonemic difference in Na'vi. But if two kays or tees come together, they'd be pronounced double as in English, not reduced to one the way vowels are. So I don't know. We really only have an answer for orthography.

[quote author=Frommer]For the days of the week, I've decided to keep it simple and do what many languages do: just go with First Day, Second Day, etc. The ordinals are simply attached to trr, but without the modifying a. So:<br /><br />Trr'awve 'Sunday'<br />Trrmuve 'Monday'<br />Trrpxeyve 'Tuesday'<br />Trrtsìve 'Wednesday'<br />Trrmrrve 'Thursday'<br />Trrpuve 'Friday'<br />Trrkive 'Saturday'<br /><br />Stress is on the second syllable in all cases.<br /><br />Note the contrast between Trrmuve 'Monday' and trr amuve (or muvea trr) 'second day' (e.g., the second day of a trip).[/quote]<br /><br />So you're a bit out of luck if your language is Russian or Chinese, but okay otherwise.

This is on the same level as the color debate (With all due respect to K. Pawl, who i think realizes that there is a place for some common ground between our world and Pandora). We don't even really know what a week, a month, or a year is, and Pandora being a moon probably complicates this picture. Nevertheless, this is useful conversationally, as the day of the week is usually a pretty important thing, at least in our lives.

Hmmm, very interesting. I agree with what people have said, this seems like a linguistic thing used by Na'vi to translate tawtute days into their language or vise-versa.

Somehow I doubt a week would be something the Na'vi would have since, due to their less scientific nature, they wouldn't care much for dividing up months or even years that precisely.<br /><br />Anyway, no matter what, for what we use the language for, this is extremely useful.

Jupiter and Saturn are very similar in this regard. So, a seven day orbit is entirely plausible. Assuming that Pandora's rotational period is clase to 24 hours, there could be normal 'days' and 'weeks' there. The interesting problem though is that there would be a period in each planetary orbit where the night would be much longer. This is due to the moon pasing behind the planet, and would be the normal case, as most moons orbit a planet's equator. But if Polyphemus is significantly tilted with respect to the ecliptic, and so is Pandora (And images of the sky suggest that Pandora's orbit is unusual), there are possible orbits that could result in days and nights being consistently the same length. That said, the ASG strongly implies and day lengths are not all similar, and that dark nights are uncommon. This adds credance to the day/night periods as varying significantly in the course of a 'week'.<br /><br />Month and year would be trickier. There really is no 'month' period that easy to define unless orbital precession results in a regularly varying day/night schedule that is longer that a 'week' and significantly shorter than a 'year'. A 'year' could be defined as either a regularly repeating pattern of stars in the night sky, or else, a third, even longer period of day/night lengths.<br /><br />Yes, I agree.

<h4>`Eylan Ayfalulukanä</h4>
I noticed that no one has picked up on the re-introduction of [p]tsaheylu[/p]. For a long time, this was in the various dictionaries as meaning 'bond (neural)'. Then one day, the word 'neural' disappeared, and this has been carried through several iterations of Taronyu's (and probably others as well) dictionary. I wonder if Pawl brought this back up to point out that the word 'neural' still really needed to be there. It also makes me wonder of there is a word for a non-neural bond, like one might have with a pet (as opposed to the bond between a man and a woman, or other 'human'). I have been calling a strong bond with an animal friend 'virtual tsaheylu'. (Is there a good Na`vi word choice for 'virtual'?)

I also think that it's fine for us to have &quot;nicknames&quot; for the days if we choose to. They'll only be relevant/meaningful if people USE them, of course. There will always be something official for us to fall back on now that K. Pawl has made a proclamation. I had suggested themes previously that roughly map to generalities about how it *feels* to go through a work week. The problem with that is that the workweek is not universal. It starts at any point from Friday to Monday depending on which country/culture one might be from. I think that nicknaming days after Pandoran flora/fauna is also a somewhat interesting approach. We don't know enough about Pandoran astronomy/cosmology to try to map anything directly to the 'Rrtan concepts embedded in our day names in the West (IMO).<br /><br />I have to agree that it seems/feels to me as well that *my* week starts on Monday. I'll always have to &quot;do the math&quot; to make sure I'm talking about the right day in Na'vi.<br /><br />&nbsp;  ;)

<h2 id="85">Aylì'u nì'ul ta Karyu Pawl</h2>
<h4>TehMightyPirate</h4>
Karyu Pawl has given us some more words and these answer many, many questions I've had, the chief amongst them being what does Tsu'tey say to the soon-to-be hunters in the movie when they start cheering for Jake.<br /><br />But first, a story! (Since it seems to be the &quot;thing&quot; to do with this little lexicon updates.)<br /><br />[desc=Well, in this story we see that Tsu'tey and Jake Sully are fighting.]Tse, mì fìvur ayoeng tse'a tsnì Tsu'tey sì TsakSulli werem.[/desc] [desc=Tsu'tey attacks Jake with a war cry but Jake moves away.]Tsu'teyl Tsakit 'oleko tengkrr perlltxe san wiya! sìk slä Tsak rolikx neto.[/desc] [desc=&quot;Dammit! Stop Tsu'tey! I will not fight you!&quot; Jake says.]San Wiya! Ftang nga ma Tsu'tey! Oel ngati ke wìyem! sìk Tsak plltxe.[/desc] [desc=Tsu'tey answers with an angry snarl and attacks again.]Tsu'tey ’eyng fa san oìsss sìk ulte 'eko nìmune.[/desc] [desc=This time, Tsu'tey's strike succeeds and cuts Jake's arm.]Fìkrr, Tsu'teyä tìtakukri ﬂä ulte mun’i Tsakä pxunit.[/desc] [desc=Neytiri screams &quot;Oh crap! Please stop you two! Please!&quot; to them.]Neytiri zawng mefuru san Tsa-hey! Rutxe ftang menga! Rutxe! sìk.[/desc] [desc=Nevertheless, Tsu'tey attacks again but Jake strikes him first with an exclamation of exertion.]Tsalsungay, Tsu'tey 'eko nìmune slä Tsakìl poanit takuk nì’awve tengkrr plltxe san sau![/desc] [desc=But then, Jake fell to the ground and Tsu'tey saw this.]Slä tsakrr, Tsak zolup ne kllte ulte Tsu'tey tsole'a fìkem.[/desc] [desc=He attacked with a charge but Neytiri jumped in front of Jake so that she could protect him.]Poan 'oleko fa kxll slä Neytiri spolä eo Tsak fte tsun poel poanit hivawnu.[/desc] [desc=&quot;Saa!&quot; She said to Tsu'tey and Tsu'tey knew that she would never love him as she loved Jake.]San saa! sìk poe plltxe Tsu'teyur ulte Tsu'teyl omum furia kawkrr poan poeru ke layu yawne na Tsak poeru lolu yawne.[/desc]<br /><br />[desc=If I made any mistakes I must say to you all; &quot;sorry&quot;.]Txo oe soli kxeyey tsakrr zene oel ayngati peng san ngaytxoa.[/desc]<br /><br />[b]ngay[u]txo[/u]a - acknowledgment of guilt and regret - CONV<br />tsalsu[u]ngay[/u] - nevertheless, even so - ADV<br />o[u]ìsss[/u] - angry snarl - CONV<br />[u]sa[/u]a - threatening cry - CONV<br />sa[u]u[/u] - exclamation upon exertion - CONV<br />tsa-[u]hey[/u] - expression of warning or frustration - CONV<br />tse - well (sentence opener) - CONV<br />[u]wi[/u]ya - expression of warning or frustration - CONV<br />ì[u]ley[/u] - war cry - CONV[/b]<br /><br />Now, some interesting details is that Frommer has told us that, with the exception of tse, ngaytxoa and tsalsungay, all of these words were created by the actors Zoë and Laz, presumably during filming. Thus, some of them don't comply exactly with the usual Na'vi phonology. As prrton pointed out to me though, there are parallels in English such as &quot;grrrr&quot;, &quot;hmmmm&quot;, &quot;hrumph&quot; and etc.<br /><br />The violators are:<br /><br />Oìsss (no final vowel after &quot;s&quot;)<br />Saa (double/long vowel &quot;a&quot;)<br />Tsa-hey (that hyphen which both prrton and I've been guessing is a slight pause as opposed to a true glottal stop)<br /><br />Now, obviously we need some good parallels for these in Enlgish other than &quot;expression of warning or frustration&quot;. Some suggestions I (and prrton as well) have are:<br /><br />[b]Oìsss[/b] - &quot;Watch it!&quot; or &quot;You're pissing me off!&quot;<br />[b]Tsa-hey[/b] - &quot;Oh crap!&quot; or &quot;Aw, hell!&quot; (probably without the vulgar nature of the English though)<br />[b]Wiya[/b] - &quot;Dammit!&quot; (again, probably without the vulgar nature)<br />[b]Sau[/b] - Totally guessing at the usage here but I picture this as the grunt one makes when trying to pick up a heavy object or some similar action.<br /><br />Oh, and finally, since prrton hadn't heard about it, I just want to add Frommer's official, un-official Na'vi version of LOL; [desc=From HeRangHam]HRH[/desc]. This is from the [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/press/frommer-interviewed-by-david-on-youtube/]YouTube interview he did[/url].

But I have some good news. My teaching responsibilities will soon end; after that I will have more time to create words and the kinds of lessons that can help everyone best learn and remember.<br /><br />In the meantime, I thank you for your patience, and I hope you enjoy today’s celebration.<br /><br />Goodbye and Eywa be with you.<br /><br />Paul[/spoiler]<br /><br />The audio is here and you can download it and listen over and over again while your DVD and/or Blu-Ray players are &quot;rewinding.&quot; &nbsp;;)<br /><br /> &nbsp;[b][url=http://masempul.org/blog/]http://masempul.org/blog/[/url][/b]<br /><br /> &nbsp;Tstxo postìyä lu [b]«Trr ’Rrtayä»[/b]<br /><br />fìFtxozä leFpom!<br /><br />ta Prrton<br /><br />[b]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/b]<br /><br />[table]<br />[tr][td] [b][u]me[/u]oaunia[u]e[/u]a[/b][/td][td] harmony, living at one with nature[/td][td] N [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [b]rey[u]'eng[/u][/b][/td][td] The Balance of Life[/td][td] N [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [b]tì[u]me[/u]'em[/b][/td][td] harmony (general sense)[/td][td] N [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [/td][td] &nbsp;[/td][td] [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [b]fnel (fne-)[/b][/td][td] kind, type[/td][td] N/PReN [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [/td][td][i]Fnel can stand alone or work with[/i][/td][td] [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [/td][td][i]another noun in the genitive to[/i][/td][td] [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [/td][td][i]to show the relationship:[/i][/td][td] [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [/td][td][i]tsafnel syulangä = &quot;that kind of flower&quot;.[/i][/td][td] [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [/td][td][i]Fne- (does not cause lenition) does the[/i][/td][td] [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [/td][td][i]same thing as a PREnoun:[/i][/td][td] [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [/td][td][i]tsafnesyulang = &quot;that type of flower&quot;.[/i][/td][td] [/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] [/td][td][i]K.

Some very interesting words in there! I like the word for hunger [b]ohakx[/b], it has a cool sound to it. The presence of [b]tsyosyu[/b] confirms a theory that has was discussed at length during the LEP about the existence of bread-like foods. The words for weeks past and future strongly imply that there is indeed a seven day cycle of some sort on Pandora.<br /><br />Thanks K. Pawl for the new words, and W.

I've written this in another place, but I feel is appropriate here. 'Tis my theory of another use for &quot;-vi&quot; that we've already seen.<br /><br />If it is what I think it is, then we COULD render the word &quot;vitra&quot; as a c.w. of &quot;vi-&quot; and a contraction of [b]t[/b]i[b]r[/b]e[b]a[/b]. All together, a soul is a small piece of [overall] spirit. (Note: I only mean this from an etymological perspective and NOT one of spiritual discussion.)

Not really idiomatoc as it does literally mean what it says, but to say &quot;I was not here&quot; I came up with &quot;oel tsengot alahe tamok&quot; which has a nice sound to it and would be interesting as a common phrase for that sort of thing. &nbsp;And it works for &quot;I was not there&quot; too.<br /><br />Edit: It occurs to me that there are a couple consonants there that could be combined by swapping two words...&nbsp; &quot;Oel lahea tsengot tamok&quot;

<h2>Re: Idiomatic Expressions</h2>
<h4>Swoka Swizaw</h4>
I don't know if this really counts, but I thought of a way for us to either refer to each other, OR (more preferred, to be honest) a way for us to refer to outsiders NOT yet introduced to Na'vi (or Avatar). In the film, humans are &quot;tawtute,&quot; yes? [i]On world[/i], this makes sense. Here, though, refering to a conceptual outsider as such, seems too trendy. BUT, I know that we want remain true to the core of Avatar.<br /><br />[b]Fpìl oel futa lu ngay fwa txo ivomum tuteo teri Na'viti, slayu pol Na'viä hapxìti...[/b]<br />It is true, I think, that whoever knows of the People becomes a part of the People...<br /><br />...that mean US - so we are all Na'vi, at heart. And to refer to another that is not &quot;in the know,&quot; we would call them: [i][b]Na'vi letawtu[/b][/i]. This way, we recognize everyone as a part of the People, but know where they come from before their insanity has been cured.<br /><br />(More or less, I am suggesting we turn Tawtute into an adjective. After we add &quot;le-,&quot; as to not have a lengthy adjective, [i]letawtute[/i], we remove the &quot;-te&quot; at the end: [b]Letawtu[/b]. The [b]tu[/b] at the end is perfect to stand alone.)

(kxawm oe ’erefu ohakx nìhawng :p) txon lefpom[/size][/font]<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I stumbled by chance on [b]tsngan[/b] last night, and was not previously aware of a word for 'meat'. As used today, 'meat' means specifically 'animal flesh'. However, we have other foods of animal origin, besides meat, such as eggs and milk. Interestingly, English (at least, maybe other languages do) does not have a specific term (even in scientific circles) for 'food of animal origin'. Thus, I would reverse what you said, and say [b]tsngan[/b] is from [b]vey[/b] like [b]tsyosyu[/b] from [b]tsyo[/b].<br /><br />Interestingly, 'meat' didn't always mean what it means today. At the time of the King James Bible (1611), 'meat' meant 'food', and 'flesh' meant 'meat'. To mean you were eating dinner, you would say 'at meat'.<br /><br />On a tangent but related topic, most cultures have taboos about meat-eating. Here in the US for instance, horsemeat is generally taboo. However, may other cultures readily eat horsemeat. We consume a lot of beef here, but cows are sacred in some parts of India. I wonder if there are taboos in Na`vi society like that? For a possible instance, an ikran that is not bonded to someone would be fair game, but one that is bonded would be like a pet or companion. Or the case could be, since some ikran are bonded to Na`vi people, ikran is off-limits as a food source. In a broader sense, most societies have things that are 'taboo' in areas besides food. In any case, this will make me check into the existence (or proposed existence) of a word for 'taboo'.

[i]vey[/i] is a recent coinage by Paul and is glossed by him as &quot;food of animal origin; flesh&quot;. [i]tsngan[/i] is an older word (we don't know how old) and is glossed simply as &quot;meat&quot;. Now, if I were to take that literally, I'd conclude that [i]vey[/i] is any animal product used as food, such as tendon, tripe, or tongue, whereas [i]tsngan[/i] is limited to muscle used for food and excludes tendon or tripe. (Is tongue &quot;meat&quot;?) But I don't know if that's Paul's intent. As for &quot;flesh&quot;, the semicolon means that this is a second definition, not a synonym. So presumably [i]vey[/i] also has non-food uses, the solid physical material of the body, whereas [i]tsngan[/i] may be limited to steaks and ribs. For many people, fish is not &quot;meat&quot;, though I'm not sure it counts as an &quot;animal&quot; product for them either. So perhaps [i]teylu [/i]is [i]vey[/i] but not [i]tsngan.[/i]

So perhaps [i]teylu [/i]is [i]vey[/i] but not [i]tsngan.[/i]<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Agreed that the body of [i]payoang[/i] may not contain [i]tsngan[/i] and it may or may not fall under [i]vey[/i]. But, a whale-like thing could also be a [i]payoang[/i] based on what I am guessing about the derivation. There might be a whole lot of [i][desc=I could never watch “The Cove”, but I'm glad the film was made and I hope it will have some impact.]tsngan/vey[/desc][/i] going on there...?? I would (currently) think that [i]teylu[/i] seems it could be [i]vey[/i] more easily than [i]tsngan[/i]. BUT, it could be neither and fall under a [i]ketenga[/i] category at the [i]vey[/i] level that would have it as a peer to something like 'Rrtan [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_(food)]poi[/url], even though it derives from a very different kind of organism. <br /><br />Overall, I think for us to really understand how things might map out for the Na'vi on Pandora, we'll need another movie, or some interstitial revelations from Kämeron on the Na'vi's epicurism. I'm no &quot;specialist&quot; on Pandoran flora and fauna, but it seems that they may have an even [url=http://bit.ly/wuzzyline]WUZZIER line[/url] for the plant/animal distinction than we do based on how I imagine a [i]syeptute[/i], etc. It doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility to me that something like that might produce [i]*tsngan lefkxen[/i].<br /><br />Some particularly interesting wuzzy examples from [i]awngeyä kifkey[/i]:<br /><br />&nbsp; - [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepenthes]Nepenthes[/url]<br />&nbsp; - [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirobranchus_giganteus]Spirobranchus giganteus[/url]<br />&nbsp; - [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysia_chlorotica]Elysia chlorotica[/url]<br /><br />I'm also a bit curious about that second syllable of [b][i]syuve[/i][/b]. Is it related to [i]ve(y)[/i] (implying that the Na'vi strongly identify or may have in the past identified as carnivores) or perhaps to the same concept that brings &quot;order&quot; to the numbers in [i]'awve, meve,[/i] etc... Of course, [i][u]syu[/u]lang[/i] may be hinting in a different (more vegetarian) direction historically... or it may just be coincidental. &quot;Yummy&quot; to think about one way or the other.<br /><br />PS: [url=http://animal.discovery.com/animals/life/spectral-tarsier.html]This guy[/url], is the most *prodigious* carnivore left in the primate realm [i]le'Rrta[/i].

However, in *most* cases that means it would be entirely optional, right??<br /><br /> &nbsp;[b]Oe new tsive'a tsat a (tsa) lu ean.[/b]<br /><br />I can see it being *necessary* to fill out meter in poetry, etc., but I imagine it's generally VERY rarely used. «Tsar»/«tsat»/«tsal» seem that they would be more common because the tend to do more to clarify ROLES within clauses. Am I really misunderstanding something? TsaW letsunslu lu nìwotx! &nbsp;:-\\ <br />[/quote]<br /><br />Hey, thanks for that! I once suspected as much, but could never confirm it, and usage seemed to point the other way. So the pronoun tsa is defective, and does not occur in the intransitive case! Good to know. <br /><br />Please confirm with Paul if you can that tsa is only used in DP's. But [i]ftu sat[/i] suggests this might not be the case.

[quote author=Prrton link=topic=8455.msg192161#msg192161 date=1272131251]<br />[quote author=roger link=topic=8455.msg191747#msg191747 date=1272103797]<br />[i]vey[/i] is a recent coinage by Paul and is glossed by him as &quot;food of animal origin; flesh&quot;. [i]tsngan[/i] is an older word (we don't know how old) and is glossed simply as &quot;meat&quot;. Now, if I were to take that literally, I'd conclude that [i]vey[/i] is any animal product used as food, such as tendon, tripe, or tongue, whereas [i]tsngan[/i] is limited to muscle used for food and excludes tendon or tripe. (Is tongue &quot;meat&quot;?) But I don't know if that's Paul's intent. As for &quot;flesh&quot;, the semicolon means that this is a second definition, not a synonym. So presumably [i]vey[/i] also has non-food uses, the solid physical material of the body, whereas [i]tsngan[/i] may be limited to steaks and ribs. For many people, fish is not &quot;meat&quot;, though I'm not sure it counts as an &quot;animal&quot; product for them either. So perhaps [i]teylu [/i]is [i]vey[/i] but not [i]tsngan.[/i]<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Agreed that the body of [i]payoang[/i] may not contain [i]tsngan[/i] and it may or may not fall under [i]vey[/i]. But, a whale-like thing could also be a [i]payoang[/i] based on what I am guessing about the derivation. There might be a whole lot of [i][desc=I could never watch “The Cove”, but I'm glad the film was made and I hope it will have some impact.]tsngan/vey[/desc][/i] going on there...?? I would (currently) think that [i]teylu[/i] seems it could be [i]vey[/i] more easily than [i]tsngan[/i]. BUT, it could be neither and fall under a [i]ketenga[/i] category at the [i]vey[/i] level that would have it as a peer to something like 'Rrtan [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_(food)]poi[/url], even though it derives from a very different kind of organism. [/quote]<br /><br />Whaat makes this more nebulous is that we (in English) play fast and loose with terms that could be generically described as 'animal tissue used for food'. The terms 'meat' and 'flesh' can be freely interchanged even in modern usage, but the word 'flesh' has a less 'culinary' connotation associated with it. To illustrate further, some would say flesh is reserved for muscle tissue, and the tissues closely associated with it, that make up the 'carcass' of a bird or mammal. The internal organs are feferred to collectively by terms of varying strength: 'entrails', 'viscera', or more culinarily, 'offal' or 'variety meats'. Yet, this is all grouped as 'fhesh' if you are describing a carnivore or 'flesh eater'. To them 'flesh' is any soft tissue. And for food group purposes, we can call any and all of this 'meat'.<br /><br />As far as [b]payoang[/b] goes, fish is generically classified as meat, even though we refer to fhsh flesh or muscle tissue as 'fish'. If the Na`vi have a distinction between they [b]vey[/b] of land animals and fish, we do not yet know about it. Also keepp in mind that whales are marine mammals, and much more like a cow than an fish. So generally, the same sort of terminology is used to describe their body as you would use for a cow.<br /><br />So, if I am reading this right, [b]vey[/b] might describe the leg of a yerik that has been cut off and is intended to be used for food. At this point, it is still anatomically complete, except for maybe the skin. But once it has been further processed into pieces for eating (and presumably had any gristly parts like tendons removed), it is then [b]tsngan[/b] But [b]vey[/b] is not intended to refer to animal food products that did not come from inside an animal's body (necessitating the animal's death to recover it), such as eggs, milk, etc.

I am hoping that this will be like the 'days of the week' situation, and we will have something basic like what might be found in a hunter-gatherer society, but descriptive enough to represent the range of real-world colors we all encounter.<br /><br />[b]Ean[/b] for instance, is now 'blue or green'. But with the strong prevalence of cyan-like tones in the Pandoran world, I wouldn't be surprised if [b]ean[/b] ends up meaning blue-green or cyan.

<h2 id="91">Na'viya - the OTHER vocative</h2>
<h4>Tiger</h4>
No, that's not a typo of Na'viyä, that is a special vocative particle -ya (Always a suffix), used with collective nouns like Na'vi. &nbsp;(Presumably then also &quot;Tsamponguya&quot; for example - though I have no other &quot;official&quot; examples.)<br /><br />So the question of what Neytiri says can be laid to rest. &nbsp;She is saying, exactly as the subtitle says, &quot;Calm, people, camp&quot; with the -ya vocative addressing &quot;the people&quot;.<br /><br />[spoiler=You want the truth? &nbsp;You can't handle the truth!]Yes, apparently the meaning did indeed come AFTER the dialog was recorded and in the final cut, and Karyu Pawl found out about it in a screening. &nbsp;But like many things, it is now canon.[/spoiler]<br /><br />I also ran the transcription we had of Jake's speech to see how close we were and got a few corrections there. &nbsp;The entirety of what was in the movie below.<br /><br />[i]fpole’ sawtutel ’upxaret<br />ayoeri tsat new<br />tsun mivunge.<br />slä awngal 'upxaret fpìye' for.<br />kämakto nìwin, ayngati spivule hufwel<br />ayolo'ru alahe peng ziva'u.<br />for peng syeraw Toruk Makto<br />tswayon set oehu<br />ma smukan, ma smuke!<br />sawtuter wìyintxu ayoeng<br />ke tsun fo fìkem sivi<br />fìtsenge... l(u) awngeyä![/i]<br /><br />For the most part, various attempts to transcribe it all got some bits right and some bits wrong and nearly everything had been correctly transcribed in one form or another. &nbsp;The only two surprises there are the &quot;lu&quot; in the final line (I mean it makes sense, but I don't think I've seen anyone suggest that it is there. &nbsp;The other is the &quot;ayoeri tsat new&quot;. &nbsp;It really... &nbsp;doesn't make any sense. &nbsp;But the reason is the whole direct quote thing of Na'vi... &nbsp;That is a translation of something like &quot;[i]The sky people have sent us a message, 'We can take whatever we want and nobody can stop us'[/i]&quot;. &nbsp;But due to time constraints it got stripped down considerably, including removing the &quot;san&quot;.<br /><br />Edit: Forgot to add, he has been quite busy but hopes that this weekend will be slow enough that he can start getting to the list of questions I sent him for the &quot;Combining our Efforts II&quot;.<br /><br />Edit II: Before it gets too far into common use, I figured I'd get a few clarifications. &nbsp;As has been suspected, -ya is ONLY for &quot;singular&quot; nouns that denote a group. &nbsp;So Na'viya of course, or tsamponguya are fine. &nbsp;Frapoya is a borderline case, but only because it is a pronoun. &nbsp;However it would be acceptable. &nbsp;(As an implication from that, I am guessing we can take that to mean if you're saying something to everyone, you can say &quot;Frapoya&quot;, &quot;ma frapo&quot; or just &quot;frapo&quot; and all are acceptable.) &nbsp;Nouns that are only a group by nature of being plural would just get &quot;ma&quot;.&nbsp; (So *suteya would never be correct.)&nbsp; And finally, -ya is never required, you can always use the normal &quot;ma&quot; vocative instead.

K. Pawl has said to me that the actors had more trouble with word final «-ä» than anything else in terms of pronunciation. (I also struggle with it quite a bit.) «Ma oeyä tsmukan» (from Neytiri's addressing the dying/dead nantang) had always sounded like «Maweya tsumkan» to me and I was assuming she was addressing him as &quot;[desc=due to passing/having passed away]peaceful[/desc] brother&quot; with no vocative «ma».<br /><br />This discussion is very enlightening for me.<br /><br />Frapor irayo seiyi.

It is likely that many of you will have seen MOST (but possibly not all of these words before). They are from K.

That's totally weird! Is this coming from an email or something? I'm asking because [i]Ma oeyä Na’viya, [lu] mawey![/i] seems to be double marked for vocative, and don't tell me it's not [i]ma oeyä[/i] in the first part because then [i][desc=correctly: ma oeyä smukan]maweya smukan[/desc][/i] (in addressing the dieing nantang) makes no sense. Of course such double marking could be allowed no problem, just wondering...<br />[/quote]If she was saying &quot;Ma oeyä Na'viya, mawey&quot; then why would it get subtitled as &quot;Calm, people, calm&quot;?&nbsp; What makes you think that's what's being said?<br /><br />And why can't it be &quot;Mawey, Na'viya, mawey&quot; and also be &quot;Ma oeyä tsmukan&quot;?&nbsp; It sounds to me like you're applying rules in your mind, then confusing yourself by them.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I was agreeing with the mawey, na'viya, mawey and ma oeyä tsmukan. It seems I was wrong with the na'viya one completely, I'm pretty good at this being wrong thing, first transitivity, then inalienable si verbs and now mawey na'viya mawey, if ever there's a dispute about grammar, we ought to just look at the two main arguments, see which one I support and go for the other.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />[quote author=Prrton link=topic=8675.msg197541#msg197541 date=1272485065]<br />K. Pawl has said to me that the actors had more trouble with word final «-ä» than anything else in terms of pronunciation. (I also struggle with it quite a bit.) «Ma oeyä tsmukan» (from Neytiri's addressing the dying/dead nantang) had always sounded like «Maweya tsumkan» to me and I was assuming she was addressing him as &quot;[desc=due to passing/having passed away]peaceful[/desc] brother&quot; with no vocative «ma».<br /><br />This discussion is very enlightening for me.<br /><br />Frapor irayo seiyi.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Does that mean karyu Pawl has told us that the line was meant to be &quot;ma oeyä tsmukan&quot; or are we going on the subtitles for that?

The thing is the agent is rarely &quot;completely&quot; missing...&nbsp; It could be misunderstood as coming from context, so unless the context is already &quot;fkol&quot; as the agent, it should probably be said I'd imagine.

That's to really give that an extra *punch*.&nbsp; Like in English if you said a word with extra emphasis.&nbsp; What prrton is referring to is just shifting the main focus, which also per frommer tends to come from the first position.<br /><br />Tsakemit fkol tung - That is allowed<br />Tung fkol tsakemit - *THAT* is allowed

I agree with tsmukan Omängum Fra'uti. By putting (most prominent area) in parentheses, I didn't mean that that is always the head. I should have written (or the 'most prominent area') because in Altaic word order, sometime that doesn't come first. In Eri's 'tail' advert campaign, I see why K. Pawl felt that the 'end' was best for the *punch*, but as a general rule, he tends to put things that are more important in earlier on. I've almost never seen a TOPIC(ìri) come late in the game, for example.<br /><br />And, K.P. specifically said (to me. Sorry I don't have it in writing) about this construct that the &quot;thing possessed&quot; should be PROMOTED (typically to the front of the action). In the practice of writing (on average), I think that would more likely be earlier on. In conversation (more like what an ad slogan would be too), that position of promotion could be elsewhere.<br /><br />The point is to HIGHLIGHT the noun in the accusative (-t, -ti, -it) wherever you the speaker think that is.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [desc=Her THROAT was being snacked upon by the vampire.]Flewit peyä näk reypayìt a vrrtepìl frarmìp.[/desc]<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Oh, and the double negative is good (&quot;very good only&quot;).&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; BUT, it's not [u]required[/u], either, according to my understanding.

That is not the purpose of this forum. &nbsp;We also generally dont go around inventing new words. &nbsp;There was a project to offer up what words are needed for the language, but that just concluded. &nbsp;However, it is already on the list.<br /><br />Please try to be more careful with your posting in the future.

I was focused on the passive aspect, more than the negation of the first half when I first commented on this.<br /><br />&nbsp;  [i]Ke'u lu ngay, frakemit tung.[/i]<br /><br />Is [i]«Ke'u lu ngay»[/i] supposed to be &quot;nothing is real&quot; or &quot;nothing is true&quot;?<br /><br />That seems perfectly valid to me.<br /><br />&nbsp;  But, [i]«Ke lu ke'u a ngay (lu)»[/i] might be my preferred translation for that.<br /><br />Spanish allows double negation but does not require it.<br /><br />&nbsp; - [i]Hay [u]nada[/u] que puedes decir...[/i] There's nothing that you can say...<br />&nbsp; - [i][u]No[/u] hay [u]nada[/u] que puedes decir...[/i] There's NOTHING that you can say...<br />&nbsp; - [i][u]No[/u] hay [u]nada[/u] que [u]nadie[/u] puede decir...[/i] There's NOTHING that ANYONE can say...<br /><br />English also allows double (and triple) negatives. They just don't happen to be blessed by the establishment.<br /><br />&nbsp; - I ai[u]n't[/u] got [u]n'[/u]more time to waste on [u]no[/u]body the likes o' you.<br />&nbsp; - I do[u]n't[/u] have any more time to waste with anyone of your ilk.<br /><br />The speaker is &quot;fed up&quot; with the behavior of the listener and is precluding the possibility of future intercourse.<br /><br />The core *meaning* is the same in both sentences. The register is quite different but completely mutually intelligible (at least in one direction). The &quot;ain't&quot; register speaker might struggle a bit with the &quot;fancy talk&quot; à la &quot;ilk.&quot;<br /><br />I've gotten the sense from K. Pawl that double (and triple) negation in Na'vi is allowed (and in many cases [u]preferred[/u]), but not required semantically in all cases. I've been using it to STRENGTHEN negativity, but [u]sometimes[/u] the most subtle, quiet message is the most powerful.<br /><br />Maybe my Spanish accent is stronger than I think.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  ;)

I think we really need a clarification from Karyu Pawl here.<br /><br />I myself don't recall any canonical sentence calling for a double negative but not having it. That leads me to the opinion that Na'vi negative concord indeed is grammatically required, as is the case with Slavic languages. By that logic, a statement like &quot;Ke'u lu ngay&quot; would be nonsensical as it would say something along the lines of &quot;There IS some thing that is true and that thing is the/a no-thing&quot;, instead of the English &quot;Nothing is true&quot; you native speakers tend to see there ;)<br /><br />However, judging by the general level of flexibility in Na'vi (word order, subordination, pro-drop, tense/aspect drop), I agree with wm.annis and omängum fra'uti that the recommended-but-not-required approach would actually fit the language better.

Also, semantically the &quot;best moron&quot; is still a loser no matter how you look at it, an adjectival modifier one way or another isn't going to make its negative connotation disappear. But yeah, I'd say that the &quot;best moron&quot; is less of a loser (or at the least a better liked one) than the &quot;worst moron&quot;, that's how it works in the only double neg language I speak, at any rate. If you're uncertain you can always stick to judgment-neutral attributives like [i]biggest, least[/i], etc.

There may be some subtleties somewhere in some nook or cranny, but for now I'd say that if the main noun/pronoun in the phrase you're talking about starts with something that's clearly derived from KE then the verb needs/requires it too.<br /><br />&nbsp; [s]Kepo kayä ne na'rìng.[/s] »»»» Kepo KE kayä ne na'rìng.<br /><br />&nbsp; [s]Kea txum fìsyuvemì lu.[/s] »»»» Kea txum fìsyuvemì KE lu.<br /><br />&nbsp; [s]Lu ke'u lehhrap mì satseng.[/s] »»»» KE lu ke'u lehhrap mì satseng (kaw'it).<br /><br />For me personally, it's best to think if it as a &quot;bad habit&quot; from English to not go check the verb to make sure it's negative too. I quite like throwing in lots of 'negativity' because it's common in Spanish (and certain English dialects/registers do it too). It makes the language more flavorful. But, I only learned yesterday that it was REQUIRED.<br /><br />Fko zene nivume nìtxan.

On a more serious (and somewhat related) note, if you have an adj/adv that's negative by default, and you negate it then you end up with the opposite term, i.e. the positive(-ish) counterpart.

<h2>Re: Idiomatic Expressions</h2>
<h4>Nywotkrr Tsamahela</h4>
Irayo for the corrections.<br /><br />I know idioms add to a language but I don't think translating English idioms to Na'vi is the right way to go about. The only way for us to get a real Na'vi idiot is for Cameron or Karyu Paul to give it to us. While the meanings of our idioms may seem like they would be obvious, most of the time is basically gibberish to everyone else. <br /><br />ex.<br />[desc=Japanese meaning &quot;to be lewd toward women&quot;]The space below a nose is long[/desc]<br /><br />[desc=Italian meaning &quot;can't stop flirting&quot;]Unable to stop being the owl[/desc]<br /><br />When we do get canon Na'vi idioms, chances are they are going to seem very outlandish. I believe Paul said himself that he doesn't want Na'vi to be a copy of English.

<h2>Re: Idiomatic Expressions</h2>
<h4>Tiger</h4>
Please read the first post of this thread. &nbsp;The point here is to gather ideas and suggest them to Frommer at some point, not to just make stuff up and call it canon. &nbsp;Yes I agree that just translating English idioms isn't the way to go, which is why I was trying to give a starting point and an idea of moving away from it.<br /><br />The thing is, idioms are idioms for a reason. &nbsp;Because they are common phrases. &nbsp;So often times, while they may be completely different, different languages can have similar idioms. &nbsp;Sometimes they aren't even that different at all. &nbsp;(e.g. &quot;I am called X&quot; is a common idiom.) &nbsp;So while the literal meaning of idioms shouldn't be translated, the concept or idea that it expresses certainly could. &nbsp;For example the way I translated &quot;I know you are but what am I?&quot; into &quot;Nga to oe&quot;. &nbsp;The Na'vi actually says nothing like what I gave as the translation. &nbsp;Rather it's a very short and concise phrase using Na'vi grammar that would be used in a similar situation.<br /><br />The idiom I was targetting there is something along the lines of &quot;I'll sleep on it&quot; or &quot;Let me get back to you on that&quot; (Or yes, the straight forward &quot;I'll think about it&quot;). &nbsp;I already said I thought what I proposed was too literal, and best to get away from the sleep analogy completely.<br /><br />Edit: It's also worth noting that several of the suggestions here are quite good, not based (That I know of) on any existing language, and even nicely tied into the Na'vi culture.

It would actually be [b]täpilvatsem[/b].<br /><br />Anyway, in Russia there is a saying that translates roughly as &quot;Words are not sparrows, once they fly off you can not catch them.&quot; &nbsp;Now literally in Na'vi this would probably be something like &quot;Lì'uri ke lu yayona, tswolayon a krr, ke tsun nga stivä'nì.&quot; &nbsp;But that's a literal translation, and I figure the Na'vi would say that soemething more like...<br /><br />[desc=Choose words like you aim arrows, once either are sfired, it ca not be undone.][b]Aylì'ut ftxey tengfya ayswizawti kan, 'awlie mesawit fkol toltem, ke tsun tsakem slivu fwa ke si.[/b][/desc]<br /><br />A bit long and unwieldy, and not ideally how I'd like to translate it. &nbsp;Also, it's more of an analogy than an idiom. &nbsp;BUT... &nbsp;Colloquailly (And this works even if the translation is cleaned up) I'd imagine it would be referenced in a short idiom.<br /><br />[desc=Think before you speak][b]Aylì'ut (ngeyä) kivan[/b][/desc]

I sort of see the main usage as being different though.&nbsp; &quot;Choose your words carefully&quot; to me carries the implication that you are expecting a response from them, and warning against giving the wrong response.&nbsp; For the Na'vi expression, I had something a little more general in mind.&nbsp; Perhaps something more akin to &quot;If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all&quot; but on a broader theme.

Ma kemeoauniaea, Prrton, wm.annissì!<br /><br />All of you offer very clever solutions, but seeing how there are at least five sound-looking ways to think about this verb, I'd say clarification from Pawl is needed. :D<br /><br />[quote author=kemeoauniaea link=topic=7660.msg204160#msg204160 date=1273125871]<br />Given the translation as appear or seem I'd say that 1 and 3 are invalid as lam probably only refers to the seeming aspect of appear rather than arriving or showing up (which would be pähem)[/quote]<br />I don't agree.

<h2 id="99">minor confirmation: uvan si</h2>
<h4>Ean Tirea</h4>
kaltxì ma oeyä eylan. (ayngal snìmaytx uvanit.)<br /><br />So here is the email conv between me and Frommer:<br /><br />[quote=me 5/4/10]Hello, Dr. Frommer. Syaw fko oeru Tirea Aean ta [url=http://www.learnnavi.org]www.learnnavi.org[/url]. I would like to make this quick, because I know you are supremely busy. I love the Na'vi language with much passion. There is just something about &quot;noun si&quot; constructions that is bugging me. They are supposed to be intransitive, right? I saw this in one of our documents on learnnavi.org:<br /><br />&quot;...and when a sentence has an si verb, the object takes the dative<br />ending: Oe uvan si ay+au-ru. I play the drums...&quot;<br /><br />For one, I thought that since uvan=game, then uvan si=to play a game. not play as in play the drums. Am I correct about this?<br /><br />Also, is that statement about si constructions using dative as a direct object true? I always thought that the dative was for indirect objects...or am I misunderstanding?<br /><br />Krrìri ngengeyä seiyi oe ngengar irayo ma nawma karyu!<br /><br />--Tirea Aean<br />[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Paul Frommer 5/6/10]Kaltxì ma Tirea Aean,<br /><br />Ngeyä 'upxareri seiyi oe irayo.<br /><br />&quot;Si constructions&quot; are unusual, I know. So let me try to clarify them a bit for you:<br /><br />It is correct that they're syntactically intransitive, with the &quot;object&quot; in the dative. One of the clearest examples is with &quot;srung si,&quot; which as you know is the verb &quot;help.&quot; In English, &quot;help&quot; is transitive--A helps B, and B is the direct object. But in Na'vi, it's more along the lines of &quot;A engages in or performs help for (the sake of) B.&quot; So &quot;I help you&quot; is &quot;Oe srung si ngaru&quot;--literally, &quot;I do helping to you.&quot;<br /><br />Some si-constructions correspond to intransitives in English, and these don't take a dative: examples are &quot;kelku si&quot; (dwell) and &quot;tìkangkem si&quot; (work). But &quot;kavuk si&quot; (betray) works like &quot;srung si&quot;:<br /><br />Po kavuk soli awngar.<br />He betrayed us. (More literally, he engaged in betrayal to us.)<br /><br />That said, the example with &quot;uvan si&quot; isn't accurate. You're right--&quot;uvan si&quot; is &quot;play&quot; in the sense of playing a game, not in the sense of playing an instrument. Some languages have the same word for both senses of play, but many, like Na'vi, do not. (We don't yet have a word for play in the instrumental sense, but it's on the list. &lt;g&gt;)<br /><br />Thanks again for your question.<br /><br />Sìlpey oe, ngeyä tìtslamur srung soli nì'it.<br /><br />Eywa ngahu.<br /><br />ta Pawl<br /><br />[/quote]<br /><br />This is obviously a minor update.

1. I agree with you, I was just searching for a nearest synonym and failed a bit.<br /><br />2. Well it is. It should be no different from &quot;po skxawng lu&quot;, both lu and lam are copulae and they both have both arguments as nouns.<br /><br />3. po skxawng lam would be no different from po skxawng lu or oe tsamsiyu lu, whilst it might often be nicer to adjective-ise it, it seems unreasonable to say that it would be required. It would mean &quot;he seems to be a moron&quot; or, slightly more archaically &quot;he seems a moron&quot;

Not being a linguist I jumped on it because I sounded plausible, if it might be more a master-slave relationship than employer-employee so be it.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Interestingly I had considered olo'eyktan oefa tìkangkem si which certainly implies a complete of lack of control on my part. Maybe it is possible to distinguish between two levels of control in causatives by using either -fa- or &lt;eyk&gt;?<br /><br />The fpi option is certainly correct.

Not really relevant in this case, but just because si-verbs use the dative where normally an object would be, doesn't mean semantically intransitive verbs can't still use the dative.<br /><br />Consider &quot;Eltu si&quot; - pay attention.&nbsp; Intransitive.&nbsp; But you can pay attention to someone, and that to someone would be in the dative.&nbsp; &quot;Eltu si oer&quot; - pay attention to me.<br /><br />For work, though, I agree that dative doesn't make much sense.

<h2 id="100">History of tsaw</h2>
<h4>neotrekkerz</h4>
So, most of this we know, but here's some further info about all the tsa and tsa'u forms (courtesy of Frommer of course):<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]Tsa isn't used by itself. Like fì-, it's only a prefix: tsatute 'that person,' tsakilvan 'that river.'<br /><br />Tsa'u and tsaw ARE used alone--they're pronouns, meaning 'that thing' or just 'it.' And they're used interchangeably. (There's no form tsau.)<br /><br />There are other such pairs as well. For example, the object form of 'that thing' or 'it' is either tsa'ut(i) or tsat.[/quote]<br /><br />And about that w:<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]Well, the development of tsaw from tsa'u is as follows:<br /><br />In fast speech, the glottal stop was likely to drop, yielding tsau. The -au- combination then quickly turned into a diphthong. That is,<br /><br />tsa'u &gt; tsau &gt; tsaw<br /><br />(Note that au &gt; aw did not happen with the word for drum, au, which retains two syllables.)<br /><br />That said, the other forms don't have the diphthong. So it's tsal, tsat(i), tsar(u), not *tsawl, *tsawt, *tsawr. In other words, these forms have gone one step further, losing the diphthong: aw &gt; a.<br /><br />All of that, I think, is pretty natural.[/quote]<br /><br />What I also take away from all this is that the [b]tsane[/b] which we use with the &quot;where&quot; conjunction [b]tsengit a[/b] is a [desc=or whatever the proper linguistic term is]contraction[/desc] of tsawne. <br /><br />Irayo K.

I have another word-usgae question.&nbsp; The word [b]tätxaw[/b] is glossed as &quot;return.&quot;&nbsp; I'm guessing that's in the sense of &quot;The humans returned to Earth.&quot;&nbsp; But does the thing that gets returned to (in this case, 'Rrta) use an adposition, or just the dative case marker?<br /><br />And, secondly, could we use *teykätxaw to mean &quot;return&quot; in the sense of &quot;He returned Neytiri's bow&quot;?

I was always confused about whether we could have tsa by itself.&nbsp; Our first quote from Frommer about it (combining our efforts I) had tsa listed by itself as &quot;it.&quot;&nbsp; Then I wasn't sure whether you had to drop the w or if it was just an option.&nbsp; Like I said, most of it we knew from before, but now at least we know concretely which forms of each version are allowed.

Paul had earlier given &quot;tsawl&quot; etc. as forms alongside &quot;tsal&quot;, so it appeared that there were two words, &quot;tsa&quot; 'it' and &quot;tsa'u ~ tsaw&quot; 'that'. The language is still being developed, and one of the worries Paul had about describing it publicly would be getting locked into things he later decided he didn't like. (There are a handful of words which haven't been released yet for that very reason.) So I have no problem with him releasing what he has and then changing his mind on some points. Better that than him keeping it confidential until he's satisfied that it's finished -- in 2015 or so.

<h2 id="101">A few quickies from Frommer</h2>
<h4>Tiger</h4>
Don't expect too much this week as he's busy with CSU related stuff (You know, his day job?) but I did get a few tidbits from this weekend.<br /><br />First was about word order.&nbsp; In the lessons I made recently I had been giving translations of OSV order as passive sentences in English.&nbsp; He wasn't entirely happy about that, not because it can't be the case, but because it wouldn't always be.&nbsp; As an example, he could not think of a case where &quot;You are seen by me&quot; would be used in English conversations, although syntactically and grammatically there is nothing wrong with it.&nbsp; On the other hand, &quot;Ngati oel tse'a&quot; would be perfectly natural in Na'vi.<br /><br />However, he still doesn't really have any sort of clear guidance as to when you would use the different word orders.<br /><br />Second is something that I have played devils advocate against for awhile, merely pointing out that we don't know.&nbsp; However, I can stop that now as we know.&nbsp; In &quot;si&quot; constructs (Excepting cases where the assisting noun is contextual) it is always &quot;noun si&quot;.&nbsp; (From examples like &quot;tsakem rä'ä si&quot;, I'd imagine adverbs like rä'ä and possibly also ke could be slipped in between, but no comment on that as I hadn't asked.)&nbsp; So the &quot;si irayo&quot; form is the exception to the rule, rather than a counter-example.&nbsp; Then again, irayo isn't a true noun anyway.

Ma Prrton, i find it interesting that there's a dedicated word &quot;to go to the mountains.&quot;&nbsp; I wonder if the Na'vi would have a similarly, unusually specific verb—to go to Iknimaya, maybe?

<h2 id="102">Kelutral aKe’aw</h2>
<h4>Plumps83</h4>
[size=12pt][font=Garamond]Ma eylan,<br /><br />early in March I wrote a little story, named »Kelutral aKe’aw«, in which I used these words:<br /><br />[b]ke[u]’aw[/u][/b] adj. = divided, torn apart, strife-ridden<br />[b]nì[u]sti[/u][/b] adv. = angrily<br /><br />With the tremendous help of Prrton, the story is, firstly, in its final form and can be read and listened to [url=http://masempul.org/2010/05/kelutral-ake%E2%80%99aw/][size=10pt][font=Verdana]HERE[/font][/size][/url]. Secondly these words got to Karyu Pawl and he approved of both words:[/font][/size]<br /><br />[quote=Paul Frommer, 7 May, 2010]I'll be delighted to give my blessing to ke'aw for &quot;divided.&quot; Very nice. I agree that with the morphemes intact as they are here, it's an appropriate way to express division. As for the stress, I went back and forth, since either way could be justified. But I finally decided on ultimate stress: ke'AW. Most (but not all) of the ke-based words (kawkrr, ke'u, kawtu, etc.) are stressed on the first syllable; stressing ke'aw on the second seems in keeping with the special (unmerged) quality of the word.<br /><br />NìSTI is fine for &quot;angrily.&quot;[/quote]<br /><br />[size=12pt][font=Garamond]Thanks again so much, ma Prrton, for the effort and the hope you put into this. <br />I hope you all enjoy the story.<br /><br />—ayngeyä Plumps[/font][/size]

<h2 id="103">Life, Death, and gerunds</h2>
<h4>tigermind</h4>
Kaltxì, ma smuk. &nbsp;I recently sent a message to Karyu Pawl asking about the words for life and death—[b]tìrey[/b] and [b]kxitx[/b], respectively. &nbsp;I was a little surprised that &quot;death&quot; wasn't tìterkup, and wanted to ask about that. &nbsp;You can read the relevant parts of my message here, if you want:<br /><br />[spoiler]We've seen the word &quot;life&quot; given as tìrey—which, as i understood it, also covered &quot;to live.&quot; &nbsp;And then we also got tìrusey—the noun form of &quot;living.&quot; &nbsp;So, i was a little surprised when we got the word kxitx for &quot;death&quot;—i had been expecting *tìterkup. &nbsp;But then, i was thinking that maybe there's a particular nuance here: &nbsp;Kxitx is the idea, the concept, the notion of death; while maybe the actual phenomenon, the expiration of the body, the very &quot;real&quot; and present death and dying would still be *tìterkup.<br /><br />And, if that's the case, i thought maybe there would be a word for &quot;life&quot; that mirrors kxitx—a word not for the day-to-day act of living, but of the concept of life, the all-pervading energy of living things—maybe we would say Life. &nbsp;Does that make any sense? &nbsp;In any case, i was wondering if you could clarify the differences in shades of meaning between these words. &nbsp;[...] &nbsp;Sleykivu utralìl lì'fyayä leNa'vi pxaya ayvurit atxur.[/spoiler]<br /><br />But of course, the important part is Karyu Pawl's reply:<br /><br />[b]ta Karyu Pawl:[/b][quote]<br />LIFE<br />The verb 'to live,' as you know, is simply rey. Tìrey has been functioning as both the abstract concept of life (&quot;Life should be joyful&quot;) and as an individual's own particular life, as in Oe tsolea palulukanit atsawl frato mì sìrey, &quot;I saw the biggest thanator I had ever seen (lit., the biggest thanator in [my] life).&quot;<br /><br />Tìrusey is the gerund form, corresponding to &quot;living&quot; as a subject or object: &quot;Living here is pleasant. I like living here.&quot;<br /><br />Note that the tì__us__ form is a general way to form gerunds, and it's entirely productive--that is, you can apply it freely to any verb and you'll get the corresponding gerund. That's in contrast to the tì__ form, the meaning of which is not always predictable. For example, tìrol means &quot;song,&quot; not &quot;singing.&quot; For the latter, you can use tìrusol, or for the abstract concept, tseo tìrusolä. That's why tì__ forms need to be listed in the lexicon, whereas tì__us__ forms don't.<br /><br />DEATH<br />To die, as you know, is terkup. Tìterkup is death in the abstract sense: &quot;Death is inevitable.&quot;<br /><br />I thought I had used kxitx somewhere in the Avatar or video game dialog, but I checked and apparently I hadn't. In any event, I was thinking of kxitx as referring to the event of an individual's death: &quot;His death was calm and peaceful.&quot;<br /><br />By the way, &quot;dead&quot; is kerusey--i.e., not (or non-) living: &quot;Hetuwongìl awngeyä swotut ska'a, fte kllkivulat keruseya tskxet.&quot;<br />[...]<br />Nga pamrel soli san sleykivu utralìl lì'fyayä leNa'vi pxaya ayvurit atxur sìk. Faylì'u alor oeru teya si nìtxan, ulte ke tswaya' oel sat kawkrr.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />So... enjoy!<br /><br />P.S. &quot;[...]&quot; Are things i've omitted because they're about where i'm going to school and such, not of interest to the community at large—don't worry, i wouldn't hold out on you ;)<br /><br />[b]Edit:[/b] I forgot to include one bit, because it was embedded in other things.&nbsp; Karyu Pawl acknowledged the point about expecting another root to complement [b]rey[/b] the same way that [b]kxitx[/b] does [b]terkup[/b]; he said he'll think about it.<br />

Using stories to teach language is nothing new. It has been used as a primary learning tool for centuries. Thusly, it is a great idea, and a priority should be made to develop a series of learning stories.<br /><br />These stories might graduated from easy to difficult, with a list of vocabulary to be learned for each.<br /><br />Reading and translating a story is one of the easiest way there is to quickly assimilating vocabulary.<br /><br />Stories should be of stbstantial length, based on the intended audience. Thus a basic reading lession might be a paragraph, the really challenging ones a page or two. The followup to the story would be a retelling in the language one is moving from and/or a comprehension quiz.<br /><br />If my Na`vi skills were better, this is something I would really enjoy working on. Well, I guess that is a reason to stick with it!<br /><br />Even though I was already a prolific writer, I did a high school course that used a self-paced reading program like this, and it helped me immensely.

So, does this mean that any tì- word can be made into a gerund with the &lt;us&gt; infix? That's more or less what I'm taking out of this (that you can't make anything into a gerund but anything that's already tì-ified can be made into one).

Other way around.&nbsp; Any verb can get the &lt;us&gt; infix becomes a gerund with tì.&nbsp; Tìrusol - n. singing.&nbsp; Tìtusìng - n. giving.&nbsp; Tìrusikx - n. moving.<br /><br />I've been assuming this for awhile, but it's good to get a confirmation.&nbsp; (In fact, it's one question off the list from combining our efforts.)&nbsp; We've actually had conflicting and/or unclear information from Frommer on this.

Being only English speaking I'm not sure I see the minefield.&nbsp; In Na'vi, it seems to be clearly an abstract noun representing the doing of the action.<br /><br />Presumably the passive gerund would also be possible with tì+awn.

I don't think that sentence in Na'vi would even use a gerund form.&nbsp; Even if it does, I'm not even sure how &quot;kelku si&quot; would look in gerund form.&nbsp; I think that's one for the list, participle (&amp; gerund) form of auxiliary verbs.<br /><br />Anyway, your English translation of those only uses a gerund for one case, then an infinitive for the other.&nbsp; I don't know german to comment on that though.<br /><br />Anyway, passive gerund....&nbsp; In English it would be &quot;being (gerund)&quot;...&nbsp; For example &quot;Being eaten will ruin your day&quot; or &quot;I like being thanked&quot;.&nbsp; In Na'vi, it would probably be something like *&quot;Tìpawnom oeru prrte' lu.&quot;

<h4>roger</h4>
Asked about those odd 'near' and 'distant' adverbs that have been tagged as 'dubious' in Wikibooks for so long. This is what he said: <br /><br />[quote author=Frommer]Stative verbs do take infixes. (Lu is the quintessential stative verb, and needless to say we have lolu, livu, etc.) So do verbs of location: tok allows tarmok, tolok, and so on.<br /><br />So how do alìm &quot;far away, at a distance&quot; and asim &quot;nearby, at close range&quot; relate to the verbs lìm &quot;be far&quot; and sim &quot;be near&quot;? Well, the first thing to note is that alìm and asim are adverbs, not adjectives. I used alìm only once in the Avatar background dialog:<br /><br />'Ì'awn alìm! &quot;Stay back!&quot;<br /><br />(Whether or not you can hear this in the final cut I don't know.)<br /><br />Sim and asim parallel lìm and alìm but don't appear in the dialog.<br /><br />Note that since they're adverbs, alìm and asim do NOT have alternate forms *lìma and *sima.<br /><br />Now how did these forms arise historically? Perhaps like this:<br /><br />'Ì'awn nìfya'o a lìm &gt; ? 'Ì'awn nìfya'o alìm &gt; 'Ì'awn alìm<br /><br />(I'm not sure about the intermediate step. Could be that it was reanalyzed nì+[fya'o a lìm] &gt; nì+[fya'o alìm]<br /><br />In any event, these a-adverbs shouldn't be considered the result of a productive process in the contemporary language. They're historical artifacts that have to be listed in the lexicon. The productive adverbial affix remains nì-.[/quote]

Not a hard and fast rule, but for root words, it is very rare that they don't syllabify as CVCV where possible, and that includes splitting diphthongs. &nbsp;There are a few exceptions but as I said it is rare.

new is ambitransitive, it only counts as transitive when the direct object (futa or another noun) is made explicit, otherwise it is instransitive, hence [desc=I want to go]oe new kivä[/desc] but [desc=I want a new bow]oel new mipa tskot[/desc] or [desc=I want to learn]oel new futa nivume[/desc].

Yes, it's /la-YON/, not *lay-ON. The orthography is defective, using the same letters 'y' and 'w' for diphthongs and approximants. (And the one we're using is even more defective, using the same letters for /c/ as for /t.s/.)

when the object of new is a verb, you dont need l and futa.<br /><br />____new v&lt;iv&gt;erb.<br />oe new kivä<br /><br />just like<br /><br />____tsun v&lt;iv&gt;erb. and all the rest of the modals are like this.<br />po tsun kivä.<br /><br />but the second that the thing you want is a material object, it needs to be accusitive and subject gets erg:<br /><br />___-l new ____-t<br />oel new ikranit.<br /><br />same for kin:<br /><br />____ kin v&lt;iv&gt;erb<br />oel kin kivä<br /><br />but for objects:<br /><br />___-l kin ___-t<br />oel kin ikranit.<br /><br />but Im thinking that for that last one, I would use must instead of need. cuz &quot;need to&quot; is kind of an English thing to say?

I say it is ungrammatical in Na'vi because Frommer says it is ungrammatical.<br /><br />Consider if &quot;oel tsun futa kivä&quot; were allowed.&nbsp; That would mean &quot;oel tsun fì'ut a kivä&quot; would be as well...&nbsp; Then one could take that to mean &quot;oel tsun fì'ut&quot; on its own works.&nbsp; Now if you can do fì'ut, why not &quot;oel tsun fìikranit&quot;?&nbsp; But... what does that mean?<br /><br />In some languages the modals can be used in that maner, but I would argue that is idiomatic, or a different meaning of the words in that context.&nbsp; In Na'vi, it is ungrammatical.

to say &quot;I like working&quot; where work is a si verb...here is something that might prove my point we would have to end up saying &quot;I like work&quot; which is not exactly the same thing, but is similar enough to get sort of the same idea across. <br /><br />the thing is in Na'vi, we say something a little closer (but not 100% the exact same thing as) &quot;to do work&quot; instead of &quot;to work&quot; meaning Oe tìkangkem si. not oe tìnkangkem. so to say doing work is good, WOULD it be &quot;tìkangkem tìsusi sìltsan lu&quot; I dont really think so.

Maybe you can solve it with attributive clauses so &quot;I like to work&quot; could be: &quot;oeru prrte' lu fwa oe tìkangkem seri&quot; literally I like that I am working, possibly by dropping the &lt;er&gt; or using krr a instead of fwa you could get it closer to what you want to say.<br /><br />As for helping is good, using srung seems very strange to me as &quot;helping is good&quot; implies that there is a benefit to he who helps whilst the na'vi you gave implies that aid is to be desired, that there is a benefit to the person being helped. Using relative clauses though, we could get: oe srung si a fì'u sìltsan lu (oer(u)) or literally this-I-help-thing is good (to me).

well yeah you can do the whole &quot;subject verb a fì'u prrte' lu subject-dative&quot; thing. that is a different thing tho. that is saying &quot;this subject verbs thing is pleasurable to subject.&quot; like you said, &quot;this I help thing is pleasurable to me.&quot; but I was being very general by trying to say that the act of assistance is good. a very broad statement that may apply to both the person helping and the person being helped.

oooooo, that explains a lot of weirdness in certain words and how some of my &quot;u's&quot; never seemed correct when compared to some of Frommer's &quot;u's&quot;.

I've thought about this. My theory is that [ʊ] was it's own established phoneme like /ì/ STILL is. It simply fused with /u/, as /ì/ might do one day with /i/.<br /><br />More or less, we are looking at Na'vi linguistic evolution.

I also agree, that's an interesting theory. I know that many bits of Na'vi arose from the actors speaking during filming (such as the vocative -ya) and I wonder if this is the same but I think you might be onto something by thinking that this was deliberate, it certainly seems that way.

<h2>Re: Life, Death, and gerunds</h2>

A lot of words, unfortunately, just the definition is not enough to understand them.&nbsp; &quot;Up to&quot; is one of those.<br /><br />&quot;It is up to me&quot; - I am the one that needs to do it.<br />&quot;Look up to him&quot; - See him as a role model.<br />&quot;Follow the road up to the freeway&quot; - Follow the road until you reach the freeway.<br />&quot;Count up to 10&quot; - Count until you reach 10.<br />&quot;Up to now&quot; - Before now<br />&quot;Run up to him&quot; - Run towards him / approach him<br />&quot;Fly up to the moon&quot; - Fly towards the moon, in an upward direction<br /><br />Those are all slightly different meanings.&nbsp; The first two are, obviously, vastly different than the rest and not covered by &quot;vay&quot;.&nbsp; Of the others they can fall into two slightly different categories.&nbsp; One is a direction to head in.&nbsp; The other is a terminal point.&nbsp; When its used as a direction it is also the terminal point, but when it is the terminal point it is not necessarily also the direction.<br /><br />Your example is using it as a terminal point and a direction.&nbsp; Frommers seem to be using it as just a terminal point.

Another argument against vay being usable like that...<br /><br />That is giving &quot;up&quot; as a direction.&nbsp; &quot;Fly up, until you reach Iknimaya&quot;.&nbsp; If you were at Iknimaya and heading to the ground you wouldn't say &quot;Fly up to the ground&quot;, you would say &quot;Fly down to the ground&quot;.&nbsp; However, we have nothing that provides the opposite sense of &quot;down to&quot;.<br /><br />Perhaps you could, however, say...<br /><br />oe new tswivayon nefä vay Iknimaya<br />vs.<br />oe new tswivayon nekll vay atxkxe

I've been kind of thinking that &quot;vay&quot; is almost used like &quot;until&quot; in many ways. &quot;vay set&quot; = &quot;until now&quot;, etc.<br /><br />So, &quot;tswayon vay Iknimaya&quot; would translate almost literally as &quot;fly until Iknimaya&quot;.

<h2 id="108">Losing and registers.</h2>
<h4>Tiger</h4>
So I had a really quick question with Frommer about the meaning of &quot;tatep&quot;.&nbsp; It means more specifically than just the ambiguous &quot;lose&quot;, &quot;lose track or awareness of something&quot;.<br /><br />But something caught my eye...&nbsp; He gave the example of its use as &quot;Tìkan tawnatep!&quot; - target lost.<br /><br />There's no typo there.&nbsp; It's an unattributed passive participle.&nbsp; So a follow up question later and I got a nice gem of a response.<br /><br />[quote=Karyu Pawl]The explanation is that this is in a clipped, military register, just as the English translation is.[/quote]<br /><br />Of course the correct Na'vi would be &quot;Tìkan atawnatep&quot; or &quot;Tìkanit oel tolatep&quot;.&nbsp; There are other markers of the military register as well, but the only hint I got on that was...<br /><br />[quote=Karyu Pawl]the shortening of the genitive pronouns: oeyä --&gt; oey [pron. wey], ngeyä --&gt; ngey, etc.[/quote]<br /><br />It's worth noting that Frommer created the military register for the video game.&nbsp; Despite the big battle scene in Avatar, there was not really a huge amount of military commands.

kinäa is correct, but eithe kinä or kina would be more likely to be what you'd hear in coversation. Frommer didn't say which way it would contract when it did. I also assume that the same rule would apply to ìi/iì as does to äa/aä.

For the three of seven, I've just had a thought, depending on some of the functions of a genitive in na'vi, it would be possible to say 3 of the seven hunters: [desc=three of them of the seven hunters]pxefo kinäa taronyuyä[/desc].

Not a likely one no, all the examples we have so far are smaller, but I was deliberately taking the &quot;spawn of&quot; concept and applying it with reckless abandon as people might if we add it in as a suffix. Another, more plausible option would be a root or the unmarked form of a verb/noun etc.

So it seems reasonable that they'd borrow the words from English, especially since they fit easily into Na'vi phonology (and fortunately for us they're not otherwise assigned in the lexicon).<br /><br />So:<br /><br />8 = 'eyt<br />9 = nayn<br /><br /> &nbsp; (To be used only with things like phone numbers.)<br /><br />[i][b]Furia fìlì'fyavit fkol ta 'Ìnglìsì molunge, sìlpey oe tsnì ayhapxìtu lì’fyaolo'ä awngeyä ke stìyevi.[/b][/i][/quote]<br /><br />[font=Candara][size=13pt][b]Trrit Nerong Txonìl[/b] &nbsp; (Night Follows Day)[/size]<br /><br />[img]http://masempul.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/trrit-nerong-txonil.png[/img]<br /><br />[size=11pt]The Pandoran day beings at or just before daybreak and follows an average cyclical pattern (to the best of our knowledge) which is punctuated by 4 regular pattern markers relating to natural light and the longer periods that fall between these milestones. The pattern markers are «trr’ong» (“daybreak/dawn”), «kxamtrr» (“mid-day/noon” - when the light is constant), «txon’ong» (“darkness falls/night unfolds”), and «kxamtxon» (“midnight”). As seasons or other celestial mechanics effect Pandora, the points at which these events occur may also change. They are relative, not absolute. Parallels to eclipses or sudden changes in ambient light in the night might also occur. These things are unknown to us at this time. This “typical” pattern and the full cycle of one morning through the day and night to the next morning is called «trrtxon». Please see the graphics to get a sense of duration and progression.[/size][/font]<br /><br />[img]http://masempul.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/trrtxon.png[/img]<br /><br />[font=Candara][size=11pt]There are three completely new terms that refer to segments of the day. They are RE.won, ha’NGIR, and KAYM. All are the creation of Karyu Pawl and their relationship to the day should be clear from the images. Because the Na’vi sleep during the night, they do not have such precise divisions for the darkness of night. There are two generic periods of txon before and after the midnight marker.<br /><br />[b]Krr ka Trrtxon lEywa’eveng[/b]<br /><br />[b] &nbsp; sresrr[u]'ong[/u]<br /> &nbsp; trr[u]’ong[/u]<br /> &nbsp; trr[u]'ong[/u]maw<br /> &nbsp; [u]re[/u]won<br /> &nbsp; sre[u]kam[/u]trr<br /> &nbsp; [u]kxam[/u]trr<br /> &nbsp; [u]kxam[/u]trrmaw<br /> &nbsp; ha’[u]ngir[/u]<br /> &nbsp; kaym<br /> &nbsp; sreton[u]’ong[/u]<br /> &nbsp; txon[u]’ong[/u]<br /> &nbsp; txon[u]’ong[/u]maw<br /> &nbsp; txon<br /> &nbsp; sre[u]kam[/u]txon<br /> &nbsp; [u]kxam[/u]txon<br /> &nbsp; [u]kxam[/u]txomaw[/b] (this spelling is correct)<br /> &nbsp; [b]txon[/b]<br /><br />The «sre-» and «-maw» periods can be thought of as belonging to the specifically named periods with which they have contact. Therefore «srekamtrr» can be thought of conceptually as the final stage of «rewon». «Kxamtrrmaw» can be considered the beginning stage of «ha’ngir» and «sreton’ong» could be considered the end of «kaym» (“evening”), but kaym does not extend conceptually past «txon’ong» for the Na’vi. Once it is dark, «kaym» is over and «txon» has begun.[/size][/font]<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl]The usual derivatives:<br /><br /> &nbsp; [b]rewo[u]nam[/u][/b] 'yesterday morning' [stress shifts to final syllable]<br /> &nbsp; [b]rewo[u]nay[/u][/b] 'tomorrow morning' [stress shifts to final syllable]<br /> &nbsp; [b]fì[u]re[/u]won[/b] 'this morning' (should be listed in the lexicon along with fìtrr and fìtxon)<br /><br /> &nbsp; And the corresponding forms for [b]kaym[/b] and [b]ha’ngir[/b].[/quote]<br /><br />[font=Candara][size=11pt][b]Krr ka Trrtxon le’Rrta[/b]<br /><br />The Na’vi do not keep time using devices, but the following “rough time maps” can provide an idea of when the Na’vi concepts of times of day might map to life on earth. Please note that 12:00 noon («º14:00 kxamtrr») and midnight (º14:00 or 0:00º kxamtxon) are locked to the earth clock in this model as a standard earth convention, but the time of trr’ong and txon’ong would change on earth based on one’s location on the planet, season, etc., so they do not appear as lexical items in this list. They cannot be consistently tied to times in a day divided into 24 sections because of their brevity.<br /><br />The Na’vi also don’t have a [u]fixed[/u] “noon” or “midnight” or a conceptual “meridian” (the ‘m’ of “AM” &amp; “PM” on earth). Their words for “pre-noon” («srekamtrr») and “post-noon” («kxamtrrmaw») do NOT mean AM and PM as on earth. These are periods of time (one of our terran hours or less) when they feel that kxamtrr is about to happen (and rewon will end), or has just occurred (and ha’ngir is beginning). We would need to live on Pandora to get a sense of how they intuit these things. Unfortunately, we just have our imaginations...<br /><br />11:00 AM on the earth clock would roughly map to º13:00 srekamtrr on earth, but 8:00 AM is not close enough to “mid-day” to qalify as srekamtrr. That would likely be the “morning” most places on Earth so º10:00 rewon.<br /><br />There are no words for discrete time divisions yet; no “hour”, “minute”, “second” equivalents.<br /><br />If you need to say 2:30 in the afternoon verbally (meaning the terran afternoon), say [b]«mune:pxevofu ha’ngir»[/b] = [b]º2:36[/b]. Just pause for the colon. K. Pawl supports these abbreviations in writing:<br /><br /> &nbsp; [b]º12:17 R<br /> &nbsp; KxT<br /> &nbsp; º2:36 H<br /> &nbsp; º4:55 K<br /> &nbsp; º10:36 Tx ([s]T[/s]) [color=brown][b]&lt;--- correction[/b][/color]<br /> &nbsp; KxTx[/b]<br /><br />Two different flavors of ’Rrtan time-keeping depending on the conventions of your region. Note that at different times of the year and different places on the planet the period of the day falls differently. These are just offered as examples. In the winter in Canada, kaym is likely well over by 5:00 PM. In Spain in summer kaym may not end until 10:00 PM. We’ll just have to learn how to adjust. It will teach us to think carefully about the geography of our own world.[/size][/font]<br /><br />[img]http://masempul.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Krr-ka-trrtxon-rrtami.png[/img]<br /><br /><br />[font=Candara][size=13pt][b]If you find all of this “interesting” you now have a way to SAY it...[/b] [/size]<br /><br />[size=11pt] &nbsp; [b]eltur tìtxen si[/b] = to be interesting / intriguing<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(A) [b]Tsa’u eltur tìtxen si.[/b] (“That’s interesting.”)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(B) [b]Tsavur oeyä eltur tìtxen soli.[/b] &nbsp;(“That story intrigued me.”) OR:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(C) [b]Tsavur feyä ayeltur tìtxen soli.[/b] &nbsp;(“They found that story interesting.”) OR:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(D) [b]Pxoeri tsavur eltur tìtxen soli.[/b] (“The three of us were interested in that story.”)<br /><br />If figuring out how many brains are involved for the genitive model is an issue, topicalize the subject(s) in -ìri/-ri and use just one brain as in the example (D).[/size][/font]<br /><br />[font=Candara][size=13pt][b]The Na’vi (youth) have slang too...[/b][/size]<br /><br />[size=11pt] &nbsp; [b][u]w•o[/u]•u[/b] = stative v. “to be amazing/fascinating” (slang)<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- If you’re a typical teenage boy:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [b]WOU Neytiri![/b] (“Neytiri is the bomb/awesome!”)<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- If you’re a linguist:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [b]Oeru woeiu lì’fya leNa’vi.[/b] (“I’m just fascinated by the Na’vi language.”)<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-If you’re a botanist.:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [b]Mì na’rìng Tsyeykìl loreyuti ’olampi a tsaswaw WOU oer nìwotx![/b]<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (“That instant when Jake touched the [i]Helicoradiam Spirale[/i] in the forest I was totally amazed.”)<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- If you’re a dad just back from a long day at the zoo with your 7-y-o<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(who fell asleep in the car) reporting to mom:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [b]Por warmou frafneioang nìtut, slä nìpxi pxesyìräfì.[/b]<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (“He just couldn’t get over all the animals, but was especially taken with the 3 giraffe.” (nb: tsyìräfì, mesyìräfì, etc...)<br /><br />[b]The origin of «wou»:[/b]<br /><br />When Jake was new to the Na’vi, he was also new to the Pandoran forest.

While the Na'vi (especially the young people who where hanging on his every word and action) couldn’t know exactly what “Whoa!” was grammatically in English, it was very clear to them that he was “impressed/amazed”. They started using “whoa!” (pronounced in Na’vi as «[u]wo[/u].u» ) more or less as a stative verb. By the time Jake became Toruk Makto, the evolution of “whoa!” to «w•o•u» was etched in the stone of Na’vi youth culture. People much older than Neytiri and Jake may hear the younger folk using it, but they don’t know exactly what it means. Compare ’Rrtan grandparents understadning how a cellphone app can be “sick”. They basically don’t. At all.

So to say “without beginning to cry” the reguar verb phrase «sgnä’i tsngivawvìk» takes «fwa» (or «a fì’u») and the regular adposition «luke» is added to the correct side of «fwa» or «a fì’u».<br /><br />Not all adpositions make sense with «fwa». Be careful.<br /><br />[b]«Sngä’i» as a modal verb[/b]<br /><br />In this particuar case, «sgnä’i» is used modally. That requires that «tsngawvìk» carry the invix «•iv•» to become «tsngivawvìk».<br /><br />[b]The contrast between «fwa/tsawa», «furia/tsaria», etc…[/b]<br /><br />There is a full set of «tsa-»-based conjucntions that corresponds to the «fì-»-based patterns.[/size]<br /><br />[table]<br />[tr][td] &nbsp; &nbsp; [b][font=Candara][size=13pt]fwa[/size][/font][/b][/td][td] &nbsp;[b][font=Candara][size=13pt]futa[/size][/font][/b][/td][td] &nbsp;[b][font=Candara][size=13pt]furia[/size][/font][/b][/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td] &nbsp; &nbsp; [b][font=Candara][size=13pt]tsawa[/size][/font][/b][/td][td] &nbsp;[b][font=Candara][size=13pt]tsata[/size][/font][/b][/td][td] &nbsp;[b][font=Candara][size=13pt]tsaria[/size][/font][/b][/td][/tr]<br />[/table]\	<br />[font=Candara][size=11pt]The most common and “default” formation is via a form in «fì-», however, when the topic being discussed is something that has been previously established between the speaker and listener, «tsa-» can indicate this distinction.

However, the speaker getting upset enough to cry about it is new, so “without starting to cry” is in «fwa» and not «tsawa». You are not required to make this distinction. This is a subtlety of the language available to those to whom this kind of granularity is important.

Odd question, how does Paul Frommer usually start/end his e-mails nìNa'vi (if he does it in Na'vi, I'm assuming he does at least sometimes)? I've never seen one in its entirety, and there's an introduction e-mail I need to translate.

That's like saying that we can't use roman numbers instead of arabic ones in english if we want to just because it's not canon. I'm just thinking about the others before putting what Frommer says as god words... Right now, there is no valid reason to use this character to express numbers aside from the fact that Frommer said that it should be the way. My decision is not personally influenced by anything as I know how to to write those characters. My keyboard layout keep them close to me which is not the case for 90% of those who want to learn.<br /><br />I don't want to sounds rash or anything but my opinion is that, right now, one of the reasons why there is such a small amount of people interested is the fact that you need to be a computer-savvy just to be able to use the language. You need to know about IRC, Skype, TeamSpeak, keyboard layouts and various other stuff. Most people don't even know that the two alt keys on their keyboard are different. If you force people to install software or need to explain them how to write unusual symbols, you're limiting the number of people that can learn it.<br /><br />I think that Na'vi is a wonderful language and that this last update is a very good source of information but I also think that the way the writing system is taking is horrible and that part of it needs to be changed before it is too late.

Its also OK for language shorthand because this is language we are discussing, and not computer science. But for identifying octal numbers, I was taught long ago that the prefix is 0o. This is a lot clearer than just 0, which can be confused for an empty place holder. I will have to find where ° is hiding on my Linux keyboard, or just add the code somewhere.<br /><br />As far as numbered nouns beiung in the singular, this is common in other languages/cultures. For instance, if I was out on a game drive in East Africa, I would tell someone 'Today, we saw 8 lion, 4 giraffe, 12 gazelle and a cheetah', not 'Today, we saw 8 lions, 4 giraffes, 12 gazelles and a cheetah'<br /><br />Lots of good material here to learn, along with some sentence construction tips (to confuse me even more!)<br /><br />I'm glad K.Pawl told the story of how [b]Wou[/b] came to be.

Looking at all the terms we have now to describe evening, I wonder if the following correlation is intentional or not.<br /><br />There are actually three classifications for 'twilight', the time between sundown and when it is truly dark. Intentional or not, it looks like there is a corresponding term for all three:<br /><br />Civil twilight-- when it is still light enough to work outside-- sreton`ong<br />Nautical twilight-- when there is still enough light to navigate by-- txon`ong<br />Astronomical twilight-- when stars begin to be visible, but its not quite dark-- txon`ongmaw<br /><br />As an amateur astronomer, I will definitely use these!

[quote author=`Eylan Ayfalulukanä link=topic=10379.msg242221#msg242221 date=1277020191]<br />Looking at all the terms we have now to describe evening, I wonder if the following correlation is intentional or not.<br /><br />There are actually three classifications for 'twilight', the time between sundown and when it is truly dark. Intentional or not, it looks like there is a corresponding term for all three:<br /><br />Civil twilight-- when it is still light enough to work outside-- sreton`ong<br />Nautical twilight-- when there is still enough light to navigate by-- txon`ong<br />Astronomical twilight-- when stars begin to be visible, but its not quite dark-- txon`ongmaw<br /><br />As an amateur astronomer, I will definitely use these!<br />[/quote]<br /><br />That's cool.&nbsp; I wasn't familiar with those terms; i'll have to, well, familiarize myself with them =)

i think there is also a little difference in meaning between the canonical Notation for Na'vi : &quot;°&quot; and a general ocatal Notation &quot;0&quot; or &quot;0o&quot;.<br /><br />In &nbsp;my opinion &quot;100&quot; is always &quot;0o144&quot; or &quot;0144&quot; but can be either &quot;°144&quot; or &quot;°140&quot; depending on how accurate/important the accuracy of &quot;100&quot; was. I think 0o.. and 0... are only the octal versions of the same same human-context-number whereas °... is only the shortened version of the spoken number. Imoh °144 should be only °144 when it is really used and spoken as zamtsìvosìng in its context.

<h4>Ean Tirea</h4>
I like 0o, but not 0 so much. I like degree sign the most...I just edited my custom na'vi layout to include a degree sign for this exact reason. Just me, but I would rather see 0o144 than 0144... to me 0144 woudnt register as octal in my mind...something about 0o i like better. I believe that there is no question about the degree sign notation tho. the only prob about the deg sign is that it is not one of the face buttons on a standard keyboard, so making a custom layout, (personally because I like to push one button and get one character out, not push like five buttons just to get a measly degree sign out) is necessary. again, I uploaded my kb for you windows users out there who care to try it out.

<h4>Taronyu</h4>
I am disappointed. I wish I weren't, but I am. I don't think that Frommer here gave as much thought as he could have to the Alpha Centauri system and how it would affect lighting. Also, he's been inconsistent with other people who've worked on the film. Here's a quote from Leri Greer at Weta:<br /><br />[quote]I actually wrote about how it causes a particular sky coloration across the visible spectrum at moments of pure dusk. And the Na'vi, depending on what elevation they live at (sea level versus higher altitudes), perceive a distinct color in narrow band at the horizon at that moment. They identify themselves, and signify in their markings, with this color. Which helps other Na'vi quickly discern at a distance what/where they are from, or what they are likely to be like (fishermen, high plains, skyriders, etc.). That pure dusk &quot;color,&quot; combined with their other predominant color markings lets you also know how they relate to Eywa as a &quot;religion&quot; versus Eywa as a physical reality. And during ceremonial gatherings you can &quot;read&quot; a Na'vi by how they mark themselves with dyes, muds, and paints. And the environment and day/night cycle is directly responsible for the development of this social expression behavior. Again, this was an internal idea to help us design things at Weta Workshop, it's hard to say how much filtered upward to the larger production.[/quote]<br /><br />And here's a link to a wikipedia article, which I've reproduced here: [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri#View_from_a_hypothetical_planet]Link[/url]<br /><br />[quote]An observer on the hypothetical planet would notice a change in orientation to VLBI reference points commensurate with the binary orbit periodicity plus or minus any local effects such as precession or nutation. Assuming this hypothetical planet had a low orbital inclination with respect to the mutual orbit of Alpha Centauri A and B, then the secondary star would start beside the primary at 'stellar' conjunction. Half the period later, at 'stellar' opposition, both stars would be opposite each other in the sky. Then, for about half the planetary year the appearance of the night sky would be a darker blue — similar to the sky during totality at any total solar eclipse. Humans could easily walk around and clearly see the surrounding terrain. Also reading a book would be quite possible without any artificial light.[84] After another half period in the stellar orbit, the stars would complete their orbital cycle and return to the next stellar conjunction, and the familiar Earth-like day and night cycle would return.[/quote]<br /><br />And here's a quote from the ASG: &quot;Complete darkness is rare on Pandora. THe large moon orbits a gas giant planet that in turn orbits a star with a stellar companion. Because of this unusual arrangment, most of Pandora's nights have some illumination; fully dark nights are few and far between.&quot; This, taken into account with the unknown rotation speed of the planet (which, I assume, Pandora is aligned to, as our moon is - but this isn't necessarily the case), would certainly result in different words for different times of nights that are relative to the kind of night that is or will occur. Polyphemus is stated as having a &quot;fast rotation&quot;, which might mean that the days may not last long enough to have all of these distinctions for twilight.<br /><br />I'm not stating I'm not excited by the other stuff. I just find this disappointing, is all.<br />

I guess that's to be expected when two or more sources don't cross-check with each other. As far as Lery Greer's comment goes, that's an awful lot of details to put in a movie, especially when the whole thing is like a big shot of overstimulation on LSD. In short, nobody but someone with a degree in cosmology would have noticed the sky colouration, just like nobody but someone with a PHd in Anthropology and Sociology would notice or try to put meaning to the color markings. This is, after all the average person we're talking about, and they barely understand why their own culture functions or how.<br /><br />I'm saying you have a lot of extremely good points and I do have a working interest in Na'vi culture, Taronyu, but as far as getting all that information into the movie it would likely be a waste of time because nobody would notice it.<br /><br />**I am not putting anybody down, I'm just being an English Lit major.

I suspect the reason that it is not more complex is that Frommer is a linguist.&nbsp; He was brought onto Avatar to develop a language.&nbsp; He can create linguistic elements, but beyond that (and even within that in some cases) he is not a source of Avatar canon.&nbsp; So trying to design a complex system of the Pandora days and seasons is probably a bit beyond his scope, even if he wanted to sit down and try.&nbsp; And if others had already thought of such thing, he may not know who it would be, or have access to them or said information.&nbsp; Even if he did create something, it would not necessarily be canon.<br /><br />The other way to look at it is the new words are poorly translated to English, using the closest earthly concept, while the Na'vi would understand the words and concepts diferently.

<h4>`Eylan Ayfalulukanä</h4>
I'll take a different tack on this. Like Taronyu and kemeoauniaea, and as an amateur astronomer myself, I am quite aware of the likliehood that Pandora probably has a very interesting day/night cycle. I haven't checked on the spacing of Alpha Centuari A and B, but I bet they are distant enough that each star has its own planetary system. Although it is possible, stable orbits are few and far between for something orbiting both stars of a binary system. The aforementioned arrangement (orbiting one star) would make for a lot of 'light nights', where the other star provides twilight-like illumination much of the night.<br /><br />The real complication though is that Pandora ia a moon of a gas giant planet. Gas giants normally have fast rotational periods. Depending on whether Pandora is tidally locked to Polyphemus, this makes for a very interesting arrangements of short days and nights, that vary considerably in length. In reality, this would create a much different situation for days/nights for Pandora that we have here on earth. The filmmakers missed this by a mile. (I do think, however, that there are one or more orbital mechanics solutions that would give Pandora a more or less regular day/night pattern.)<br /><br />That said, the purpose of the film was to tell a story and communicate a message. Although a lot of details were attended to, apparently JC felt that trying to have a realistic day/night cycle was probably 'stretching things too far'. Therefore, the days and night as observed in the film are much like ours.<br /><br />So, even though a very irregular day/night cycle is more likely, I will take at face value that it is more regular and adopt these terms to my conversational use. Although I know we have all discussed (especially this group of people) the appropriateness of some of these concepts (color is another one&nbsp; ;) ), I think K. Pawl, as well as most of us, would like to have Na`vi be something we can use in our daily lives, or among friends to describe things we experience on a daily basis (Thus we have days of our week as words, etc.) I don't think this limits Na`vi in any significant way, as words describing finer details of things can be added as we go along.<br /><br />At least in this case, K. Pawl did leave significant flexibility to address varying day lengths, but without a rigid time schedule like we use. I also think that by now, the Na`vi would have worked out the day/night pattern (which would be regularly recurring, but some components could take 'months' or 'years' to repeat) to a point where the 'astronomer' in their midst ( perhaps the Tsahìk) would have a pretty good idea how long or short a particular day or night will be. I also suspect that although the Na`vi's day/night behavior is similar to ours, that they are much more active at night than we are.

&quot;Gas giants normally have fast rotational periods&quot;<br /><br />Am I missing something? A couple of people have said this now, yet it's utterly irrelevant for light-dark cycles. All it means is that the storm spots of Polyphemus will cross the disk quickly; it will have no effect on the length of the Pandoran day, nor on the phases of Polyphemus lighting up the night, which will depend instead on Pandora's orbital period. Tidal locking of Pandora has nothing to do with the length of the Polyphemian day.

I believe they're referring to the fact that some moons are theorized to be created by accretion during formation of the planet and if I remember correctly this usually means that they inherit the angular momentum of their forming planet. It's either that or the impact theory that causes the similar angular momentum. Also, an accreted moon with share the angular momentum of it's parent planet so the rotational speed of the gas giant will have an effect on the orbital period of the moon so this would affect the phases of Polyphemus.<br /><br />In any case, I do see where you're going.

Io has a 42-hr orbit, yet that was still too close to Jupiter for Galileo to survive for long. (Galileo had to stay away from Io most of the time, and even close approaches to Europa were risky.) In the movie, there were several other largish moons inside the Pandoran orbit, too. Cf. the Jovians, the Ganymedean day is a terran week, and the Callistonian is 2 weeks.

Kaltxì, ma smuk.&nbsp; Random thought (apologies if it's been brought up before):<br /><br />Does lenition occur on proper names?&nbsp; Like, does fpi+ Tsu'tey become *fpi Su'tey?&nbsp; <br /><br />The only real-word example i know of is consonant changes in Turkish:&nbsp; Some suffixes cause lenition (i suppose that would be the term) to some consonants at the ends of the words they affix to.&nbsp; So, for example, if you want to say &quot;my angel,&quot; that's melek+im--&gt;meleğim.&nbsp; If, however, you have a friend named Angel (about whom you're feeling possessive), Melek+im instead becomes Melek'im.&nbsp; The important point here, though, is that even though the original spelling is retained in the case of proper nouns, the pronunciation still changes as usual.&nbsp; But Na'vi, obviously, doesn't actually have a writing system.<br /><br />So, what do you think?

<h2 id="111">Some IPA News</h2>
<h4>Taronyu</h4>
So, I couldn't resist, and emailed Frommer with some questions. Here are the questions and the responses: they concern diphthong presentation, secondary stresses, and the u and ʊ distinction. <br /><br />[quote=Taronyu]<br />I have a small question about the diphthongs. (Taken from a thread on LN:) Kemeoauniaea raised some good points in this thread, stating that my IPA notation of the diphthongs may not, in fact, be accurate. He, from his admittedly not-extensive look into IPA, would submit that:<br /><br />[ ɛj ] [ aj ] [ ɛw ] [ aw ]<br /><br />be replaced with<br /><br />[ ɛɪ̯ ] [ aɪ̯ ] [ ɛʊ̯ ] [ aʊ̯ ] .<br /><br />Note: Wikipedia: The diacritic &lt; &nbsp;̯&gt; is placed under the less prominent component to show that it is part of a diphthong rather than a separate vowel, though it is sometimes omitted in languages such as English, where there is not likely to be any confusion. <br /><br />I initially had brushed this off as just differences in notation, but I think he actually has a really good point. The way I'm telling it now, there's no difference between 'e.wll and new. I think that the diphthong ought to be reflected and different: also compare yem and 'eyng. <br /><br />So, I figured I'd ask you before I go through changing them, if this is what you envision the Na'vi sounds to sound more like. I know that you've said that:<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]Open syllables always use a tense &quot;u&quot; pronunciation. &nbsp;Closed syllables can be either tense &quot;u&quot; or lax &quot;ʊ&quot;. &nbsp;There is no rule for which to use in closed syllables. &nbsp;So tsun, for example, can be either &quot;tsun&quot; or &quot;tsʊn&quot;, but &quot;lu&quot; is always &quot;lu&quot;, never &quot;lʊ&quot;.[/quote]<br /><br />So I wanted to make sure before I go through and possibly mess things up.[/quote]<br /><br />And his response! Very detailed, as always.<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]Sìpawm asìltsan.<br /><br />There's variation in how people use IPA to transcribe diphthongs.<br /><br />Kemeoauniaea is right that most transcribers seem to use the vowel+vowel method (with or without the diacritic under the second element in the case of &quot;falling&quot; diphthongs). But [aw], [aj], etc. are also used. Note what the Wikipedia &quot;Diphthong&quot; article says:<br /><br />&quot;The less prominent component in the diphthong may also be transcribed as an approximant, thus [aj] in eye and [ja] in yard. However, when the diphthong is analysed as a single phoneme, both elements are often transcribed with vowel letters (/aɪ̯/, /ɪ̯a/).&quot;<br /><br />A well-known textbook for students in introductory linguistics classes, Edward Finegan's &quot;Language: Its Structure and Use,&quot; uses the vowel+approximant method, as I tend to do myself. I spoke to Ed about this, and he said he had considered using vowel plus vowel but decided against it.<br /><br />So the bottom line is that [aj], [aw], [ej], and [ew] are used by some if not all professional linguists in an IPA context; the way you currently have it is justified.<br /><br />That being said, you and Kemeoauniaea raise a valid point about possible ambiguities in transcription in certain circumstances. A clear example, I think, would be:<br /><br />maweya ikran<br /><br />If you transcribe the first word as [maweja], without showing the syllable boundaries, it's not clear whether the structure is (with D=diphthong) CVCVCV, CVCDA, CDVCA, or CDDA. (It's intended to be CVCDA, of course.) If you include the syllable boundaries, however, the ambiguity disappears: [ma.wej.a] can only be CVCDA. Same for 'ewll. It's true that [?ewll] is ambiguous, but if you insert the correct syllable boundary--[?e.wll]--then it's clear that ew is not a diphthong.<br /><br />So it's really up to you. Either method is, I think, fine, as long as you've indicated the syllable boundaries. Perhaps the easiest solution would be to include a brief note somewhere, saying something like: &quot;An alternate method of transcribing diphthongs, not use here, is . . . &quot; and then illustrate the 2-vowel method.<br /><br />As for your statement about the transcription of u, it's correct. In a word like tsun, some speakers will use the tense and others the lax pronunciation.[/quote]<br /><br />In a follow up email, I asked him for stress information about the following words that have two stress marks, because I've been wondering for ages which was the secondary and which was primary. <br /><br />[quote=Frommer]<br />[u]Ey[/u]wa [u]Nga[/u]hu &lt;&lt;&lt; I've included this, because it would presumably be said a single intonational phrase, and might have secondary stress. I may be wrong.<br />Eywa[u]'e[/u]veng &lt;&lt;&lt; Shoudn't this have two, being a compound polysllabic word?<br />[u]ik[/u]ni[u]ma[/u]ya &lt;&lt;&lt; Please, was there ever a derived form *ik sky or *maya heaven, or perhaps mountain (which we don't have a word for!)<br />[u]me[/u]oaunia[u]e[/u]a<br />[u]pa[/u]lu[u]lu[/u]kan<br />[u]tal[/u]i[u]o[/u]ang<br />ti[u]re[/u]a[u]fya[/u]'o &lt;&lt;&lt; presumable main on RE<br />ti[u]re[/u]apäng[u]kxo[/u] &lt;&lt;&lt; presumably main on RE as well<br />[u]U[/u]nil[u]ta[/u]ron [/quote]<br /><br />And here is his response!<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]<br />Primary vs. secondary stress:<br /><br />In [u]Ey[/u]wa [u]nga[/u]hu, the two stresses are equal.<br /><br />[u]Ey[/u]wa[u][b]'e[/b][/u]veng: Yes, you're right: secondary stress on Ey, primary on 'e.<br /><br />For the others:<br /><br />In [u][b]tal[/b][/u]i[u]o[/u]ang and the two ti[u][b]re[/b][/u]a- words, the first stress is primary.<br /><br />In all the others, it's the second stress that's primary.<br /><br />As for iknimaya, that's a James Cameron word, and I don't know its derivation<br />[/quote]<br /><br />What a good day. ˆ____________ˆ<br /><br />ta Taronyu

As for the[i] iknimaya[/i] question, I remember hearing it pronounced as [u]ik[/u]ni[u][b]ma[/b][/u]ya in an interview.

I never said your notation wasn't accurate, just that it was the minority transcription from what I'd seen.<br /><br />Whatever, we've got a Frommerian carte blanche so that's good.<br /><br />On an unrelated side-note, as regards u, closed syllables include those without an onset if I understand correctly so uvan and unil (and derivatives) could both take the lax pronunciation ko? The only reason I ask is that I had though that the pseudo-vowels were only allowed in open syllables but then found out that they had to have an onset so I'm just checking that when we say closed we actually mean closed and not something broadly similar as we did with open syllable ll and rr.

For rr and ll, frommer does not only explain their structure in terms of requiring an open syllable.&nbsp; Rather he describes them as taking the place of the vowel in CV syllables specifically.&nbsp; So the required onset is just the nature of the psuedovowel syllables.&nbsp; (It just so happens that also means they must be open syllables, but it is not the defining feature.)

So, I was checking my dictionary today against a massive sheet that Frommer gave us ages ago, and found some words that weren't in there, for various reasons. Some might have been held back - let me know if so, and I'll remove them. We might know these anyway, but since I think some people only go off of my dictionary, here they are anyway. Here is what I added:<br /><br />fratxon - adv. every night<br />hìkrr - n. second, very short time<br />kefya srak - phrase. isn't that so? Right? no?<br />mawkrr - adv. after, afterwards<br />ngeyn - adj. tired<br />ngopyu - n. creator<br />nìk'ong - adv. slowly<br />pamtseotu - n. musician<br />sat - pn. that (after ftu only)<br />tsal - pn. that, it (transitive subject)<br />tsat - pn. that, it (object)<br />tsaw - pn. that, it (intranstive subject)<br />tsawlhì' - n. size<br />lehrrap - adj. dangerous<br />keyawr - adj. incorrect<br /><br />And I changed the stress for keyawr, lefpomtokx, Otranyu, tsa-hey<br /><br />And two new words from a recent post by Omängi fra'uti:<br /><br />lì'fyavi - n. expression, bit of language<br />nafì'u - adj. such<br /><br />Interesting, no?

<h4>Taronyu</h4>
[color=green]Tse... Today I was cruising around online and saw that Mech's wiktionary had some words I hadn't seen before. I searched a bit harder, and found that Pandorapedia had a ton of plant names that the ASG didn't have. So I added all of those to my dictionary, and then wondered about the stress. Luckily, Frommer is the man. So: Here, for the first time, is the correct stress and spelling for all of the plant names he made for the botanists. Pretty fricken cool. They're all in the dictionary appendix, now. Worth noting: utral utu mauti, the push banana fruit, is the only non-Frommerian word (figures). All the rest are 100% awesome. <br /><br />[table][tr][td][/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]’ä[/u]’o[/td][td]pitcher (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]’am[/u]pirikx[/td][td]leaf pitcher (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]’e[/u]le’wll[/td][td]thorny paw (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]anì[u]he[/u]yu[/td][td]fibonacci (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]a[u]pxa[/u]ngrr[/td][td]delta tree[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]awai[u]e[/u]i[/td][td]banshee of paradise (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]e[/u]an[u]e[/u]an[/td][td]cheadle (plant) [i](both stresses primary)[/i][/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]e[u]ya[/u]ye[/td][td]warbonnet fern (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]fkxa[/u]kewll[/td][td]thistle bud (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]fle[/u]fle[/td][td]sols delight (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]fngap[/u]sutxwll[/td][td]anemonoid (plant)[/td][/tr] <br />[tr][td][u]fwä[/u]kìwll[/td][td]mantis orchid[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]hì[u]rum[/u]wll[/td][td]puffer (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]kll[u]pxi[/u]wll[/td][td]lionberry (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]kxay[/u]lte[/td][td]cillaphant (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]lo[u]re[/u]yu[/td][td]helicoradian (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]mìn[/u]yu[/td][td]twisted lily (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]mul[u]pxar[/u][/td][td]roosterhead (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]pa’[/u]liwll[/td][td]direhorse pitcher plant[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]pam[/u]tseowll[/td][td]cat ear plant[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]pay[/u]wll[/td][td]dapophet (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]peng[u]hrr[/u]ap[/td][td]binary sunshine (plant)[/td][/tr] <br />[tr][td]pxay[u]zek[/u]wä[/td][td]spiny whips (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]pxi[/u]ut[/td][td] razor palm[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]pxi[/u]wll[/td][td]hermit bud (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]pxor[/u]na’[/td][td]episoth (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]pxor[/u]na’[u]lor[/u][/td][td]sari (plant) [i](Also both stresses primary)[/i][/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]rawp[/td][td]bladder pod (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]rum[/u]ut[/td][td]puffball tree[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]sma[u]o[/u]e[/td][td]phalanxia (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]sngukx[/td][td]grub plant[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]som[/u]tìlor[/td][td]popsicle (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]syep[/u]tute[/td][td]hyneman (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]ta[/u]utral[/td][td]beanstalk palm[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]taw[/u]tsngal[/td][td]panopyra (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]tì[u]haw[/u]nuwll[/td][td]spartan (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]tom[/u]pawll[/td][td]geode (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]to[/u]rukspxam[/td][td]octoshroom (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]tsawl[/u]apx(angrr)[/td][td]unidelta tree[i](short form tsawlapx)[/i][/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]tstxa[/u]’a[/td][td]canalyd (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]tsyori[u]na’[/u]wll[/td][td]cycad (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]txll[/u]’u[/td][td]hookagourd (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]txum[/u]paywll[/td][td]scorpion thistle (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]txum[u]tsä’[/u]wll[/td][td]baja tickler (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]vä[/u]fewll[/td][td]centipede (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td][u]vä[/u]rumut[/td][td]vein pod (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]yom[u]hì’[/u]ang[/td][td]dakteron (plant)[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]yomi[u]o[/u]ang\	[/td][td]chalice plant[/td][/tr][/table]<br /><br />[color=green]While many of these might not seem relevant, there are a ton of useful compound words in there that help in memorizing normal words.

<h2>Re: Some Glossed-over Words</h2>
<h4>Taras</h4>
I agree with Omängum fra'uti. &quot;Sat&quot; and other words with [b]-ti[/b] can be only an object, but with adpositions ([b]ftu[/b] or others) they never are objects of actions.<br /><br />[b]Oe kolä [u]ftu tsaw[/u][/b] - only thus, I think ;) <br /><br />(Perhaps here must be &quot;tsatseng&quot; instead of &quot;tsaw&quot;, however for this example it is not important)<br /><br />[quote author=omängum fra'uti link=topic=10755.msg254866#msg254866 date=1278193813]<br />it would be &quot;saw&quot; or &quot;sa'u&quot;<br />[/quote]<br /><br />But I think here can't be &quot;saw&quot;. This word means &quot;sky&quot; in plural (or with leniting adp.) and seems to me that we must use &quot;sa'u&quot; only :) Or perhaps it is the another example of ambiguity, if we can use &quot;saw&quot; as lenited &quot;tsaw&quot; :D

Right, I agree saw wouldn't be correct.&nbsp; But &quot;sat&quot; is listed as &quot;that after ftu&quot; from Frommer, so there's SOMETHING there that's irregular.&nbsp; Given that it was in the ASG, it seems like it came out a bit early to just be a dialog slip-up canonized.

There are a few on here that make me curious about possible root or other corollary meanings:<br /><br /> - fle<br /> - mul<br /> - pxar<br /> - rawp<br /> - sma (if it indeed stands alone)<br /> - tstxa ( tstxa’ ? )<br /> - txll<br /><br />«Sngukx» *feels* to me like it would simply be that as a name for the plant and nothing more.<br /><br />I particularly conceptually like «tautral» and the fact that the sawtute named it after an ’Rrtan fairytale.

Good catch, Roger. I missed those when I compiled my second list. Frommer doesn't say that JC made them, but they're in the script. Well...<br /><br />Beyral is, but it's illegal.<br />Silwanin is.<br />Ninat is. <br /><br />Yes, huyuticaya could just be a mispelling... and so could Beyral be one of Pxeyral. <br /><br />No name for Horse in the 2007 script...

I was walking through town the other day after a storm passed, and thought of a cool phrase for storms, I think. <br /><br />krr rusikxa ayrìkä - time of the moved leaves<br /><br />I was thinking of using mìn, turn, but the shortened version of the above could be<br /><br />rikxrìk - turnleaf<br /><br />which just reminds me of the sounds the trees make when they rub against each other. (In Pirahã they say that is when the trees copulate o.O)<br /><br />What do you guys think? (Sorry for necroposting, figure this is more of a constant contribution thread anyway.)

<h2 id="115">The Wiki Canon &amp; Corpus</h2>
<h4>Taronyu</h4>
Kaltxì ma frapo,<br /><br />There is an amazing resource that I don't think is getting the attention it deserves. This subforum here is instrumental in hashing out what Frommer means from his messages, but isn't really suitable when trying to find that exact linguistic example, or trying to remember what Frommer said about &quot;uvan si&quot;. But there is a place for that sort of search - the wiki. Here are the pages I think are most useful:<br /><br />[list]<br />[li][url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php/Main_Page]The Wiki Main Page[/url] - The Central Hub, as it were. [/li] <br />[li][url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php/Corpus]The Corpus[/url] - Where all official Frommerian updates should go.[/li] <br />[li][url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php/Canon]The Canon[/url] - Where all emails from Frommer are placed. This is where most of the stuff on this board has gone, or [i]should go[/i]. [/li]<br />[li][url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php/Canon/2010/March-June]The More Recent Canon[/url] - From March to June. I don't know why these are split up, but this is just as useful as the above one.[/li]<br />[li][url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php/Na'vi_from_Avatar_Movie]Lines from Avatar[/url] - For when you can't figure it out.[/li]<br />[li][url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php/Vocabulary]Vocabulary[/url] - This is a great resource. I've found words in here that weren't in my dictionary, and it has examples for many of the words - which I don't. [/li][/list]<br /><br />There's another page worth mentioning: the [url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php/Help_Wanted]Help Wanted[/url] page. The wiki is a user-changed system - You can go on right now and delete everything, you have that sort of power (don't). What you can do to be constructive is to look around here, and every time that you see a new post, put it in the wiki. I use this as my definitive guide to how to speak Na'vi - if everything we knew was in here, we could all use it to improve ourselves. <br /><br />I just wanted to point this out. Seriously, the wiki is awesome: sar fkot! <br /><br /><br />

[font=Book Antiqua][size=12pt]So, yeah.<br />The splitting up of the Canon is a little odd, the way it is right now.<br />I would do<br />1. an entry page and put everything on sub-pages with a little navigation between them, or<br />2. everything on one page, which will get a confusing (too).<br />Either way, I think they need a kind of reformatting, maybe even a kind of index.<br /><br />The Movie Lines, are nice, I wanted to gloss them, but I was lazy lately, therefore I have not done much for a while. There section with &quot;Attack on Hometree&quot; is somehow incorrect, probably will do this today.<br /><br />[url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php/User:Ochristi/Construction/Na%27vi_from_Avatar_Movie]» [u]This[/u][/url] is how far I came. :)<br />[/size][/font]

Yeah, the split of the canon pages is because the main one was getting too huge — huge enough for the Wiki software to complain (the same is currently true of the Vocabulary as well).&nbsp; A reorg of that might be nice, but it would also break a zillion links throughout the rest of the wiki, since we often reference the canon and corpus items for examples.

Yes, I had gotten the application prepared and sent it to Frommer to finish off and send in. &nbsp;He's been sitting on it awhile but I did remind him of it recently. &nbsp;I figured he would be the best point man on it; though I was prepared to step in if he didn't get it done in the next month or two. &nbsp;(My understanding is that the request has to be in by October to be considered next year, so there was still time.)<br /><br />But that is not to say it had to come from him, and he has quite a bit on his plate.<br /><br />Edit: Looks like my understanding was wrong and it would have had to be in by September 1.... But it is being delayed.<br /><br />[quote=sil.org]The Candidate Review Period for the 2010 series of change requests for ISO 639-3 will be delayed for a minimum of two months.

<h4>`Eylan Ayfalulukanä</h4>
A few new word suggestions.<br /><br />[b]Increase[/b], might be more useful as as 'increased'. Strangely enough, there is a request for 'increasingly'. Examples: 'The youngster showed an increase in his interest in hunting' or 'The rumbling from the volcano increased every day'.<br /><br />Oddly, there is a suggestion for 'decrease'. Again, 'decreased' might be more useful. I'll leave it up to the linguists here to decide which form or forms of these words are more useful. The same examples above also work with 'decrease' or 'decreased'.<br /><br />[b]worsen[/b] Example: 'The raging infection in his wound only served to worsen his mood'.<br />[b]Improve[/b] Example: 'After yesterday's heavy rains, the weather can only improve'.<br /><br />[b]aerobatic[/b] A term used to describe aerial maneuvers, done for both show and combat. Example: 'She did aerobatic maneuvers while riding her ikran'. Perhaps 'maneuvers' (or just 'maneuver') might be a good word addition as well. Examples: 'The war party practiced maneuvers in preparation for battling the skypeople'. 'He could maneuver his pali into the most difficult places'. I didn't check to see if these has been suggested, but I doubt they have.

<h2>Re: Combining Our Efforts II</h2>
<h4>MIPP</h4>
I think I found something new *.*<br /><br />A few days ago I was reading the wikipedia in Portuguese, and I found an interesting thing about diphthongs. Looks like in Portuguese, there are &quot;growing diphtongs&quot; (I don't know the word in English, I'm sorry), which are diphthongs, but reversed. E.g. A normal diphthong would be: &quot;ay&quot; or &quot;aw&quot;, and a growing one would be &quot;wa&quot; or &quot;ya&quot;. You know what I mean, right? So, I checked the Na'vi dictionary and I noticed something: Y and W are always in diphtongs: either the normal ones (aw, ay, ew, ey) or reversed (ya, yo, wi, etc).<br /><br />I'm putting it here because I don't know if anyone has ever noticed it...<br /><br />Well, in portuguese it is called as a &quot;Ditongo Crescente Oral&quot;, which literally means &quot;Oral growing diphtong&quot;. Here is the link: [url=http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fonologia_da_l%C3%ADngua_portuguesa]http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fonologia_da_l%C3%ADngua_portuguesa[/url]. Use CTRL+F to find the text: <br />[quote]Ditongos crescentes orais<br />/wa/\	/ˈkwatɾu/\	quatro\	<br />/we/\	/lĩˈgwetɐ/\	lingueta\	<br />/wi/\	/lĩˈgwisɐ/\	linguiça\	<br />/wo/\	/ɐˈkwozu/\	aquoso\	<br />/wɔ/\	/ɐˈkwɔzɐ/\	aquosa\	[/quote]<br /><br />You may translate it using a translator... But what matters here is not if &quot;yo&quot; is a diphtong (for example), but that y and w always are with other vowels, after or before.

Japanese noun modifiers do only come before the nouns. I only gave Japanese as an example of why I [u]feel[/u] the way I do about the &quot;floating&quot; adpositions in Na'vi.

That's where my question comes from. And because we have [i]-a-[/i]-influenced &quot;stacking constraints&quot; (shall we call them?), I do feel it's convenient to be able to have the adpositions &quot;float&quot; toward the front of the noun phrases.<br /><br />Of course, in a theoretical construct that &quot;convenience&quot; could have evolved over many many generations, but your proposal that the case marking &quot;pull&quot; encliticizes the adpositions makes a great deal of sense.<br />

What you're describing ma kayrìlien is the difference between collective nouns and uncountable nouns (also known as mass nouns).<br /><br />If a noun has no plural form then it is uncountable but not necessarily collective, it would only be collective if it refers to a group of other nouns. Bread and bread are uncountable but not collective; group, herd, clan etc. are collective nouns but are countable.<br /><br />Assuming the rules are exactly as they have been explained and there is no inaccuracy in that explanation, syuve etc. which do not take the plural would not take -ya and would instead have to take ma.

I agree with most others for words for simple fractions. 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4th would cover most needs. A word for fraction bar would be interesting and useful to us, but how useful to a Na`vi?<br />We also have generic fractional term - [b]hapxì[/b]. Decimals? Again, useful to us, probably not a concept the Na`vi have.<br /><br />But functional math-- that is truly interesting to think about. Since they have a pretty complete number system (which includes zero), they probably have the ability to at minimum add and subtract. Whether they can do more math, like multiply and divide, is almost a James Cameron question. But it wouldn't surprise me if they can.<br /><br />If they can do the basic 'four function' math, then I bet they are aware of the concept of pi. This is something that would be immediately useful in constructing almost anything that is round. That said, it would almost certainly be a fraction and not a decimal, and probably a fairly crude one (by our standards) at that.<br /><br />Beyond pi, I doubt they have much in the way of higher math. One possibility though, might be a means to extract a square or cube root. Such calculations were vital to the construction of siege engines. I think it had something to do with the diameter of sinew bundles (used as torsion springs) as it related to some other aspect of the machine's design. This was so important to the early military designers that they built a simple mechanical device for extracting cube roots. If I recall, it looked like a carpenter's square of some sort, and was somehow laid over a line drawn on something. The users of this device did not understand they were extracting a cube root. Instead, they had apparently learned this particular relationship through trial and error measurements, and made a tool that allowed them to easily figure out this dimension for other sized components.

The concept of pi? Sure, but perhaps not in any more detail than &quot;to pxey lu nì'it txan&quot; :P<br /><br />There is also a slight difference between may and can in English too. May implies permission, while can implies ability, although this distinction is mostly blurred now.

Perhaps over time, they noticed that amount of leather required was just a bit over three times the diameter of the drum frame. To make it easier to make drums, maybe they figured out that (and this is a bit of a stretch) that they need 22 units of leather for every seven units of drum diameter. They may have even made a tool that calculates this relationship similar to the tool I described earlier, which extracts a cube root. As far as understanding the concept of pi as a very important transcendental number, that is reserved for my fictitious high-tech Na`vi tribe living mostly underground on the other side of Pandora&nbsp; :-X

I have a new thought—about thought, actually.<br /><br />In English, we have the questions &quot;What do you think?&quot; and &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;, which, maddeningly enough, don't mean the same thing.<br /><br />&quot;What do you think?&quot; is short for &quot;What do you think of/about X&quot;—what are your thoughts on a specific topic?<br /><br />&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; is a more general question, akin to &quot;What's on your mind?&quot;<br /><br />In [desc=I think. &nbsp;Francophones, please correct me]French[/desc], the former is covered with [i]Qu'est-ce que tu penses?[/i] and the latter with [i]Qu'en penses-tu?[/i] (although, for the former, one can also ask [i]Comment tu trouves X?[/i]—lit., How do you find X?)<br /><br />(And then, of course, there's also &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;, which is more of a &quot;you did something really stupid and i can't imagine how you thought it was a good plan&quot; thing, but we can tackle that idiom some other day...)<br /><br />So, how do we ask these questions in Na'vi?<br /><br />If we don't already have answers, i would like to humbly put forth my own suggestions: &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;What do you think [ of X ]?&quot; could be conveyed with [b][ X-ìri ] fyape fpìl nga?[/b]—although you could make a case for going the French route and saying [b]X-it pefya ngal run?[/b]<br /><br />Then, for &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;, i'd say either [b]Ngari aysäfpìl lu peu?[/b], or the somewhat more idiomatic [b]Ngari aysäfpìlìl tok pesengit?[/b]<br /><br />So, [i]what do [u]you[/u] think[/i], ma smuktu?<br /><br />Ngaytxoa if this has already been covered; i looked but didn't find it anywhere.<br /><br />[b]Edit:[/b]&nbsp; Went in and fixed a spelling error.&nbsp; This is what happens when my brain runs on autopilot...

Here's some extended context:<br /><br />Klingon does not have four cardinal directions, but three: [b]chan[/b], [b]'ev[/b] and [b]tIng[/b]. The first is, simply, due east. The other two are, more or less, 40 degrees west of north and south, respectively, so it's not quite as simple as a division into thirds. To get more specific, any of these terms can be combined, e.g. [b]'ev tIng[/b] or [b]tIng 'ev[/b] would signify due west (the middle of [b]'ev[/b] and [b]tIng[/b]) etc. Also, as with other directional words in Klingon, these are not actually [i]directions[/i] per se, but rather nouns carrying the notion of &quot;area toward the east&quot; and so on, so they are used in a genitive relationship with something else. For example, &quot;I saw the eastern sky grow dark&quot; would be rendered as [b]HurghchoH chan chal 'e' vIlegh[/b] (lit. &quot;I saw the sky of the area to the east grow dark&quot;).<br /><br />Turning back to our own world, the Sámi have (or at least originally had) a different basic conception. If you look in a North Sámi-Swedish dictionary, you might find [b]lulip[/b] with the meaning &quot;east&quot;, [b]oarjip[/b] for &quot;south&quot;, [b]alip[/b] for &quot;west&quot;, and [b]nuortap[/b] for &quot;north&quot;. However, if you looked in the corresponding [i]Norwegian[/i] dictionary instead, the same words (or variants thereof) would stand for different directions! But how come?<br /><br />Well, the answer can be sought in that the underlying concepts are more relative than they are absolute. Even within Sweden, as much is evident from the maps of the mountain areas, where there are a number of places where a feature designated [b]alip[/b] is situated directly [i]north[/i] of its [b]lulip[/b] counterpart. Much of Sámi society has been centered around the reindeer for hundreds of years, and they move up into and down from the mountains with the seasons. In northern Sweden, the rivers rise in the west (the Scandinavian Mountains making up the border to Norway, as well as the central watershed of the peninsula) and flow to the Gulf of Bothnia in the east, and their courses have long served as migration routes, directly or indirectly. So, rather than signifying &quot;west&quot; as such, [b]alip[/b] is perhaps better thought of as &quot;upstream the waterways, towards the mountains&quot; and [b]lulip[/b] &quot;downstream the waterways, towards the sea&quot; -- and if the river happens to be running in a north/south direction at a certain place, &quot;irregularities&quot; as per above can occur.

[size=11pt][font=Georgia]And there I thought I over reacted 8) Don’t get me wrong, I see the usefulness of halves, quarters and so on and I don’t want to play down the Na’vi’s ability for higher mathematics. Look at the old Egyptians, Mayans, Aztec and so on… Their maths, especially for calculating star constellations is amazingly precise! Then again, that was knowledge only known to the ruling or priest-like class. <br /><br />Ma Lance, ma William,<br /><br />I was reminded of that again by reading the NYT [url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/magazine/29language-t.html?_r=1]article[/url] that K. Pawl suggested in his latest blog, the directional system of the Guugu Yimithirr people really racked my brain … but in a good way :D <br /><br />The Klingon system is indeed interesting and I couldn’t remember one bit having read that anywhere when I dealt with the language. <br /><br />The Hupa text is highly interesting.<br /><br />On a similar note, I remember that the dwarves in Tolkien’s world orient(?) their maps eastwards which makes looking at a [i]atxkxerel[/i] rather disorienting at first glance…<br /><br />I know I ‘hated’ the Irish directional system although it’s not that complicated… They mostly differenciate between the speaker in motion or positional (similar to what we have in Na’vi with [i]neto[/i] and [i]mìso[/i]). But you also distinguish a movement away from the speaker and toward the speaker. So there are at least 3 words for e.g. ‘above’<br /><br />[i]Tá mé thuas.[/i] – I am above/on top.<br />[i]Tá tú ag dul suas.[/i] – You go up.<br />[i]Tá sé ag teacht anuas.[/i] – He comes down/from above.<br />So, although one root (*uas) remains the same, the meaning changes depending on the relative position of the speaker; and the verb you use. (Something like *tá mé ag dul anuas. would not be possible) <br /><br />Same goes for ‘down’, ‘east’, ‘west/behind’ and ‘yonder’<br />Every time it’s confusing to me to think myself into that [i]fpìlfya[/i] but it definitely makes you more aware of your surrounding…[/font][/size]

<h2 id="123">Na'vi Language Workshop: The Poll of Outstanding Questions</h2>
<h4>Lance R. Casey</h4>
[color=blue]This poll is intended to gauge the opinions of the LearnNa'vi.org community regarding which questions about the language are the most important right now. The topics herein have been retrieved from [b][url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/combining-our-efforts-ii/]Combining our Efforts II[/url][/b], sorted, and in some cases merged, and this is the result.<br /><br />[b][size=12pt]ALL[/size][/b] members get [b][size=12pt]7[/size][/b] votes to cast, and as the voting progresses the topics that people feel should be prioritized will begin to float to the top. The end result will be collected into a document to be sent to Karyu Pawl in preparation for the [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/news-announcements/navi-language-workshop/][b]Na'vi Language Workshop[/b][/url], with some more context to further define the questions.<br /><br />The poll options are given in the form of terse titles, which are elaborated upon below. If there is something you don't understand, or feel should be clarified further, please do not hesitate to post your question here before casting your votes.<br /><br />Also, please take note that the poll will run for exactly three days, and whatever the standings are at the end of those three days will constitute the final say of the community – no additions after the fact will be possible. Therefore, use your votes wisely, and don't delay too long in doing so.[/color]<br /><br /><br />[b]A full kinship system[/b]<br />Frommer thinks that we need this and has already been given context and suggestions, so its inclusion here is meant to probe what importance the community ascribes to it.<br /><br />[b]Transitivity with verbs in [i]‹eyk›[/i][/b]<br />The causative infix changes the transitivity of verbs; intransitive ones are made transitive, and transitive ones are made ditransitive. Can it be used freely, and are the resulting constructions predictable?<br />How does it apply to [b]si[/b]-verbs? How are the cases handled then? ([b]Si[/b]-verbs are always intransitive, but what would be the direct object with a transitive verb is here the indirect object instead, which means that there might already be a dative in play.)<br />Is the resulting verb always transitive, and must the subject then always be in the ergative, or can the verb be understood in a general sense?<br />What happens when the base verb is a linking verb ([b]lu[/b], [b]slu[/b], [b]'efu[/b])?<br /><br />[b]Transitivity and infix positions for all known verbs[/b]<br />Before being explicitly told so, we did not know that, for example, [b]sngä'i[/b] was intransitive and that &quot;begin something&quot; would be [b]sngeykä'i[/b]. There are more verbs like this that need clarification, and also some ambiguous ones such as [b]tsunslu[/b] and [b]kenong[/b] where it is not obvious where the infixes should go.<br /><br />[b]Rules of [i]ke[/i][/b]<br />Must [b]ke[/b] always come immediately before the verb? How about [b]si[/b]-verbs?<br />Do the same rules apply when [b]ke[/b] is embedded, e.g. [b]zenke[/b]?<br />Is there an [b]*ake[/b] form to complement [b]kea[/b]?<br /><br />[b]Negation with adverbs[/b]<br />Inside or outside ([b]ke nìwin[/b] or [b]*nìkwin[/b])?<br />[b]Ke[/b] or [b]kea[/b]?<br /><br />[b]Rules of [i]txo[/i][/b]<br />When is the subjunctive required? Canon examples are contradictory.<br />Are there specific rules for the protasis (the condition) and the apodosis (the conclusion)?<br /><br />[b]Word order with [i]slu[/i][/b]<br />[b]A slu B[/b] – does A become B or B become A? Is there a rule to determine which becomes which?<br /><br />[b][i]Fì'u[/i], [i]fìkem[/i] and actions[/b]<br />When a subordinate clause is comprised of an action, can we use [b]fwa[/b] et al or must we use [b]fìkem a[/b]? (E.g. &quot;To write this word in Na'vi is difficult.&quot;)<br /><br />[b]Rules of [i]-pe+[/i][/b]<br />Can you apply the interrogative affix [b]-pe+[/b] to any noun to form a &quot;which&quot; question?<br />How do you combine [b]-pe+[/b] with number prefixes? Do they meld, like [b]fay+[/b] and [b]tsay+[/b]?<br /><br />[b]More comparative constructs[/b]<br />What happens when there is nothing for [b]to[/b] to be relevant to? (E.g. &quot;there is no faster ikran&quot;)<br />Can the superlative marker [b]frato[/b] be applied to other parts of speech than adjectives? How?<br />&quot;The more A, the more B&quot;?<br />&quot;A is as Q as B&quot;?<br /><br />[b]Rules of [i]sä-[/i][/b]<br />How and when do you (Paul Frommer) create nouns with this prefix?<br /><br />[b]More on [i]si[/i]-constructions[/b]<br />From which word classes can [b]si[/b]-verbs be built?<br />How are participles formed? (E.g. &quot;a clarified question&quot; from [b]law si[/b] or &quot;a careful hunter&quot; from [b]nari si[/b])<br />Can there be double datives? What would normally be the direct object is shifted to the indirect object with [b]si[/b]-verbs (e.g. [b]srung si oer[/b] [i]help me[/i]), so what do you say when you need another indirect object?<br />Can the base noun take modifiers? (E.g. would [b]kem awin si[/b] be &quot;do a quick action&quot;?)<br /><br />[b]Phonological issues[/b]<br />Are final stops unreleased also in situations like [b]po[u]t[/u] oel tse'a[/b]?<br />When do unstable vowel sequences decay? (E.g. [b]äa[/b], [b]iì[/b])<br />Are double vowels always prevented? Is [b]sei[u]y[/u]i[/b] generalizable?<br />What happens when adpositions are added to words that end in the same vowel or consonant that the adposition begins with? [b]Oe[/b] + [b]eo[/b] = ?<br />Similarly, what about indefinite [b]-o[/b] added to words like [b]fya'o[/b]?<br />Is [b]sengi[/b] from [b]s‹äng›i[/b]? If so, what is the cause of the sound change?<br /><br />[b]Does [i]pum[/i] have plural forms?[/b]<br />If so, when are they used? We know from the listening excercise at Na'viteri that [b]pum[/b] by itself can refer back to a plural noun.<br /><br />[b]Clarification on participles[/b]<br />Can an active participle take a direct object?<br />Can you create a gerund from [b]‹awn›[/b] like you can with [b]tì-[/b] + [b]‹us›[/b]? If so, what would it mean?<br />Can you use a passive participle with an intransitive verb? If so, what would it mean?<br />What other infixes, if any, can the participle infixes be used with?<br /><br />[b]Rules of [i]tsnì[/i][/b]<br />We have [b]sìlpey tsnì[/b] and [b]ätxäle si tsnì[/b]. What is the general rule?<br /><br />[b]Combinations of pre-first position infixes[/b]<br />In a blog post at Na'viteri, Frommer said that these infixes can indeed occur together, and gave the example [b]z‹äp›‹eyk›o[/b]. What is the full story?<br /><br />[b]Combinations of tense infixes[/b]<br />Are we correctly hearing [b]tspìmìyang[/b] in the movie for [i]I was about to kill him[/i]? If so, is this indicative of how different tenses can be combined, i.e. with future tense following past tense?<br /><br />[b]Are [i]kä-[/i] and [i]za-[/i] productive prefixes?[/b]<br />For example, is there a [b]*kämunge[/b] (bring from a place) to complement [b]zamunge[/b] (bring to a place) and [b]munge[/b] (take, bring)? Can they be attached wherever such a distinction would make sense?<br /><br />[b]Which verbs can or must use the modal syntax?[/b]<br />Apart from the actual modal verbs ([b]new[/b], [b]zene[/b] etc.), we know that sentences with [b]fmi[/b] and [b]sngä'i[/b] are constructed in the same way: [b]oe zene kivä[/b] [i]I must go[/i], [b]oe fmayi kivä[/b] [i]I will try to go[/i]. Which other verbs use the same syntax?<br /><br />[b]Tense with modal verbs[/b]<br />In a modal sentence (e.g. [b]oe new tsive'a Uniltìrantokxit[/b] [i]I want to see Avatar[/i]), which verb is inflected for tense? That is, if the preceding statement were referring to the past, would it be [b]namew[/b] or [b]tsimve'a[/b]?<br /><br />[b]Special plural cases[/b]<br />Is there a plural &quot;who?&quot; ([b]*fesu[/b]) when you know there are multiple persons involved?<br />Is the plural of [b]fì'u[/b] [b]ayfì'u[/b] or [b]fayu[/b]? Are there differences of meaning to these?<br />How do you combine [b]fra-[/b] with demonstrative prefixes? That is, how do you say, &quot;all these rules&quot;?<br /><br />[b]Synonyms[/b]<br />Several words in the lexicon have similar or identical translations. Are they true synonyms, or are there nuances?<br />[b]Na/pxel[/b], [b]hawnu/tìhawnu si[/b], [b]nìn/tìng nari[/b], [b]way/tìrol[/b]?<br /><br />[b]What kind of &quot;good&quot; is [i]sìltsan[/i]?[/b]<br />Morally/not evil, favorable/advantageous, ??<br /><br />[b]Inherent number of [i]tsopì[/i][/b]<br />Does [b]tsopì[/b] refer to a pair of lungs (or whatever number the Na'vi have), or only to one part?<br /><br />[b]Rules of [i]nang[/i][/b]<br />When and how can you use [b]nang[/b]?<br /><br />[b]Use of [i]tätxaw[/i][/b]<br />This word means &quot;return&quot; in the sense of going back to something. How do you specify that something: using cases or adpositions?<br />What would be the meaning of the causative [b]teykätxaw[/b]? Could it be used for &quot;give back an object to someone&quot;?<br /><br />[b][i]Txan[/i] and [i]pxay[/i] with temporal words[/b]<br />Do you choose which to use based on whether the word in question is countable? In English we have ”much time” (uncountable) but ”many years” (countable). Do you say [b]pxaya zìsìt[/b] or [b]txana zìsìt[/b]?<br /><br />[b]What kind of &quot;think&quot; does [i]fpìl[/i] refer to?[/b]<br />See [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/intermediate/to-think/]here[/url].<br /><br />[b]Meanings of [i]nì'aw[/i][/b]<br />Can it mean &quot;merely&quot; as well as &quot;only, exclusively&quot;?<br /><br />[b]Productivity of reduplication[/b]<br />We have [b]letrrtrr[/b] (ordinary) and [b]krro krro[/b] (at times). Can you create other repetitive concepts in the same way?<br /><br />[b]Attribution of adpositional phrases[/b]<br />[b]Fìpo lu vrrtep a mì sokx atsleng[/b] [i]It's a demon in a false body[/i] – is the [b]a[/b] always required?<br /><br />[b]Use and formation of adjectives[/b]<br />Can we use more than two attributive adjectives with one noun ([b]eana txìm atsawl[/b])? How?<br />Can you use noun suffixes or enclitic adpositions together with the deriving prefix [b]le-[/b]?<br />When an adjective is created by adding both [b]ke[/b] and [b]le-[/b] (e.g. [b]keltsun[/b]), is the attributive marker optional as it is with [b]le-[/b] on its own? That is, [b]tute akelfpomtokx[/b] or [b]tute kelfpomtokx[/b]?<br /><br />[b]Completion of answer-word chart[/b]<br />Filling in the blanks [url=http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Na%27vi/Questions#Answer_words]here[/url].<br /><br />[b]Does Na'vi have any ideophones?[/b]<br />[url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideophone]WP article[/url]<br /><br />[b]&quot;X out of Y&quot;[/b]<br />How do you say, &quot;Seven hunters went into the forest, but only three of them returned&quot;?<br /><br />[b]Application of gender suffixes[/b]<br />Are [b]*foan[/b], [b]*ngae[/b] etc. possible pronoun forms?<br />Can [b]-an[/b] and [b]-e[/b] be freely attached to any word where they would make sense, or is there a fixed set of allowed terms?<br /><br />[b]One-time occurrences[/b]<br />Are there words used in only one set phrase, and/or a phrase that is only used in one very specific context?<br /><br />[b]How do you say &quot;[noun] is [prep] [location]&quot;?[/b]<br />Since [b]tok[/b] is transitive it does not seem to work here, and if [b]lu[/b] cannot function as &quot;be in a place&quot;, then what other options are there?<br /><br />[b]Other functions of the genitive[/b]<br />Which are there, other than a simple possessive? [b]Utral Aymokriyä[/b] [i]Tree of Voices[/i], for example.<br /><br />[b]&quot;Self&quot; and &quot;own&quot;[/b]<br />Are there words corresponding to &quot;myself&quot;, &quot;herself&quot; etc.?<br />Is there a way to distinguish between &quot;he ate his (own) food&quot; and &quot;he ate his (someone else's) food&quot;?<br /><br />[b]Number system extensions[/b]<br />Decimal numbers (3.14 and suchlike)?<br />Very large numbers? Do they exist?<br />Negative numbers?<br />Simple fractions and a word for &quot;half&quot;?<br /><br />[b]Dates in Na'vi[/b]<br />How do you say them?<br />Do the Na'vi have months, and if so, what are they called and how are they used?<br /><br />[b]Asking/giving permission[/b]<br />Do we use [b]tsun[/b] or something else?<br /><br />[b]Asking/giving directions[/b]<br />How do you say, &quot;go to the right&quot;?<br /><br />[b]Cardinal directions[/b]<br />Do the Na'vi think in terms of a compass rose, or do they have a different conception of direction? Absolute or relative?

Tewti, ma Prrton!&nbsp; Frakrr leiu ngaru sìlronsema aysäfpìl apxay fìtxan.<br /><br />And you're right, English is full of these theoretically uncountable words that are sometimes, erm, countable.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are lots of words like [b]people[/b], [b]fish[/b], [b]grass[/b]... that in plural form mean &quot;different kinds of...&quot;.<br /><br /><br />And then, of course, there are words that are sometimes uncountable, but the countable forms are sort of a different shade of meaning:<br /><br />&quot;All [u]life[/u] is sacred&quot; vs. &quot;Many [u]lives[/u] were lost&quot;<br /><br />&quot;[u]Death[/u] is the mind-killer&quot; vs. &quot;There were three [u]deaths[/u] in the battle&quot;<br /><br />Or, one i really like:<br /><br />&quot;[u]Love[/u] is all you need&quot; vs. &quot;He had two great [u]loves[/u] in his life&quot;<br /><br />(Maybe this is something that mostly happens to &quot;abstracts&quot; in English?)<br /><br /><br />So, long post made a lot shorter:&nbsp; I'd love to get some feedback on this from Karyu Pawl =)<br />

There were quite a few tied places, so in the tradition of sports results I have given such items the same ranking, since neither takes precedence over the other, and then jumped a corresponding number of steps for the next non-tied entry. For example, there are four questions which had the same number of votes for place #11, so the next number in the sequence is #15.

Ultimately, that's what I think K. Pawl will care about. The way Tsm. Lance prepared everything for delivery to him clearly demonstrates the topics' meanings and import.<br /><br />The last page shows EVERYTHING as it was dumped out of the poll and K. Pawl was told that every person got UP TO 7 votes. He's a mathematician as well as a linguist. He'll figure it out if he cares about that level of detail.<br /><br />

<h2 id="125">Stress shift in OMUM is irregular</h2>
<h4>Prrton</h4>
<br />I've heard «omum» pronounced by K. Pawl both with stress on O and on U. This is not 'normal' for Na'vi, so I asked him. And he answered:<br /><br />[quote=Paul Frommer to Prrton via e-mail 26 Sept., 2010][size=11pt][font=Arial]<br />Your ears didn't deceive you. I vacillated on the stress for this word. And after thinking about it, I want to make this an exception to the general rule that the stress doesn't shift for derived forms. (A few odd quirks and exceptions make a language interesting, kefyak? &lt;l&gt;)<br /><br />So for omum only:<br /><br />When the word is in root form, the stress is on the second syllable:<br /><br />Oe oMUM. Ke oMUM oe.<br /><br />But in derived and inflected forms, it shifts to the o:<br /><br />New oe iVOmum.<br /><br />NìawNOmum . . .<br /><br />Etc.<br /><br />P.<br /><br />[/font][/size][/quote]<br /><br />So there we have it. An irregular verb.<br /><br />Yeay! (I think)&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br />

<h4>Prrton</h4>
The Language Workshop is over and the fact that it’s over is kind of &quot;very sad only&quot; but everything that happened was well, WOU!<br /><br />I personally did not take notes, but tons of others did and will also be posting photos in the next few days too. This new tidbit is something little but nice before I get very busy with a new work project tomorrow.<br /><br />Tsmukan Hufwe ta’em was aware that I was planning to show his avatarization done by the very very talented Tsmuke Kxeyey to K. Pawl over the weekend. K. Pawl also saw others by the very very talented Tsmuke Tìngay Mungeyä. He liked them all very much. But, Tsmukan Hufwe ta’em sent me “more than one PM mail” over the course of the weekend asking about his photo. ;)<br /><br />[img]http://masempul.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sre-maw.jpg[/img]<br /><br />This morning I explicitly asked K. Pawl what brief message he wanted to say to Tsm. Hufwe ta’em about the pic (seeing them both side by side. His response was:<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; [b][i]Eana relìri leiam nga sayrìp nìtxan nang![/i][/b]<br /><br />There are two things that are particularly interesting about this (to me).<br /><br />(1) It contains a new adjective [b]«[u]say[/u]rìp»[/b] (“handsome/good-looking” (primarily of males)), (2) It means roughly “It’s nice for me to see you look extremely handsome in your blue photo.” (He didn’t comment specifically on the non-blue version (“before”) photo, but I wouldn't take that personally.) ;)<br /><br />The grammar uses the topical marker [i]-ìri[/i] and that’s on the “photo”. The phrase «mì rel» (or «relmì», “in the photo/picture”) does not appear anywhere in what he said. This is a good reminder to us to not try to do “literal” translations directly from English all the time.<br /><br />I asked him about how «sayrìp» relates to «sevin» and «lor» (both of which we have had for a long time).<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; [b]lor[/b], adj. generically “beautiful/pleasing to the senses” (of things or parts of peoples features as well)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; [b]se[u]vin[/u][/b], adj. “pretty” (primarily of females)<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; [b][u]say[/u]rìp[/b], adj. “handsome/good-looking” (primarily of males)<br /><br />So, thank you ma Hufwe ta’em and ma Kxeyey (and, of course, ma K. Pawl), for the new word!<br /><br />

I must admit in being a little disappointed that they would distinguish masculine beauty vs feminine beauty in the language, given how little gender seems to matter in many other aspects of the language. But I suppose not everything has to be different, and in fact making everything different would perhaps have made it feel less natural and more contrived.<br /><br />Still, new stuff is always txantsan nìtxan nang.

(Guys and girls, anyone? Instead of guys and gals?)<br /><br />I'm of the mind that a lot of the gender-specific words in English only persist that way because of social tradition; which can lead to any number of strange consequences, including, for example, the uneasiness that men have when attempting to complement each other's appearance. It seems to me that if we tried to reduce the number of gendered words in the language (remember we're talking about a language that doesn't have an equivalent word for Na'vi [b]po[/b]), we might be able to eliminate some of the longstanding sexual prejudices still inherent in society.<br /><br />But I digress. I agree with Omängum Fra'uti; it's moderately disappointing to see gendered words, from an altruistic perspective, but he's right; having one or two examples of gendered pairs does make the language seem more natural, almost as if there were once more examples of this phenomenon that have now faded into obscurity (sort of like how words like [b]po[/b] only need the masculine/feminine suffixes once rather than every time)<br /><br />I didn't really answer your question, ma Prrton.

Keep in mind also that in English (although much less in 20th century usage - I'm thinking more L.M. Montgomery's writing style here, or Arthur Conan Doyle, if you're more familiar with him) the word &quot;handsome&quot; can refer to women also, just as &quot;beautiful&quot; can refer to men, it's more that &quot;handsome&quot; has an implied connotation of strength as well as a well-made form, while &quot;beautiful&quot; has an implied connotation of softness or gentleness along with that same well-made form.<br /><br />By which I mean that a &quot;handsome woman&quot; might be tall, with a powerful upright carriage and a face which is symmetrical but perhaps more stern or in possession of particularly strong features, whereas a &quot;beautiful man&quot; would likely be, by most standards, somewhat effeminate.

<h4>Tiger</h4>
That's exactly my point... Calling one word beutiful for women and another handsome for masculine feels strongly like it is applying our cultural values. In our culture, it would indeed be strange for many men if they were called pretty, but the word is sevin, not pretty. Who says that it would be strange for a man to be called sevin?<br /><br />What i am saying is that for there to be different words implies some different standard that they are to be held to, something i am not sure I see precedent for in the Na'vi. The only other word in Na'vi which is totally different based on gender is mother and father, but that is totally justifiable, as each IS held to a different role in the birth of a child by biology.<br /><br />It still doesn't sit right with me having two words, but if it is to be, so be it.

Ah, but you see, the standards for attractiveness between males and females are different<br /><br />And that's not cultural at all, that's biological.&nbsp; So for me, having one word for &quot;male-like attractiveness&quot; and another word for &quot;female-like attractiveness&quot; makes perfect sense.&nbsp; Just because the Na'vi have a more egalitarian society than our own, it doesn't mean they aren't aware of the differences between males and females, or that they aren't capable of expressing those differences with different words.<br /><br />So I see where you're coming from, but I think your understanding of the implications of the words is a little...one-sided.<br /><br />Sorry if that came out wrong. :-*&nbsp; I'm a bit tired and having trouble mincing my words properly for an emphasis-poor forum such as the internet.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&gt;.&gt; and wow, apparently my level of formality rises in direct proportion to the state of exhaustion I'm functioning under.&nbsp; Good to know, that. ::)

OUR standards of attractiveness are different. Yes it is partly biological, but it is also evolutionary as to why they are the way they are. But our biology is different than theirs, as is our evolutionary path. So who is to say that their standards of attractiveness are equally different?<br /><br />It would be interesting to look at how different languages and cultures on earth deal with this.

<h4>wm.annis</h4>
Rather than crush everyone with a massive dump of information, we're going to spend the next two weeks or so making posts in the &quot;Language updates&quot; with a few items each post. &nbsp;It'll give people a chance to assimilate everything new, as well as give other participants a chance to chime in if they remember some tidbit. &nbsp;Several of us took notes, but no one of us caught everything.<br /><br />You will recall that there was a poll in which you could vote for seven questions for Frommer. &nbsp;Member Lance R. Casey collected and sorted the results, with a PDF available in [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/navi-language-workshop-the-poll-of-outstanding-questions/msg313139/#msg313139]this post[/url]. &nbsp;When you see something like &quot;(#12)&quot; at the head of a section, that refers to question 12 from the poll. &nbsp;Remember that some items may have the same number, due to how the poling numbers worked out.<br /><br />One thing I can say, that Frommer mentioned as part of another question but which make sense to just announce here, is: there will be no new infixes. &nbsp;Any new grammar he creates will use other means.<br /><br /><br />[b]Dates and Kinship (#4, #1)[/b]<br />We did discuss these issues somewhat, but both matters wander solidly into Cameron's territory, so Paul couldn't really decide much (as we expected). &nbsp;One clear detail I recall, though, is that he approved of borrowing from English the names of months — for purely Human use — since these Latinate names are very widely used all over this planet. &nbsp;Any other vocabulary of time needs to work sensibly with the Na'vi cultural context.<br /><br /><br />[b]Transitivity and Infixes of Existing Verbs (#2)[/b]<br />He produced a list of all the verbs with infix locations and transitivity clarified. &nbsp;He'll be sending that list to Taronyu to work into the dictionary. &nbsp;I'll try to get a copy, too, to make sure the Wiki vocabulary is up to date, too. &nbsp;<br /><br />While Frommer likes the simplicity of the floating dot notation for marking infix location, it's a nuisance for him to type into his own records of Na'vi vocabulary. &nbsp;So, he came up with his own system. &nbsp;It takes two digits to indicate infix location, the first one indicating which syllable first position infixes go into, the second one indicating the location of the second position infixes (simple enough). &nbsp;For example, [b]'efu[/b] is 12 — the first syllable ([b]'e-[/b]) gets the first position infixes and the second ([b]-fu[/b]) gets the second position infixes. &nbsp;This is the usual pattern for non-compound verbs of two syllables, such as the ever popular [b]taron[/b]. &nbsp;<br /><br />For another example: [b]'awstengyem[/b] [i]join[/i] is 33 — all infixes go into the third syllable, [b]-yem[/b] (that means this verb is a compound). &nbsp;Some more interesting examples:<br /><br /> [b]tsunslu[/b] 12<br /> [b]zoslu[/b] 22&nbsp; &nbsp; (Note: fixed Oct 8 2010)<br /> [b]tungzup[/b] 12<br /> [b]emza'u[/b] 23 (transitive)<br /> [b]kllfro'[/b] 22 (intransitive)<br /><br />Note that it's not entirely predictable where a compound verb is going to get its infixes.<br /><br /><br />[b]Self/own (#2)[/b]<br />The question here is the ambiguity in &quot;he cooked his dinner&quot; — is &quot;his dinner&quot; someone else's or his own (referring to the subject of the sentence). &nbsp;Most human languages have ways to distinguish this. &nbsp;Now Na'vi does, too: [b]sno[/b] (genitive [b]sneyä[/b]) [i]his/her/their own[/i]. &nbsp;Notice that this word isn't changed for number. &nbsp;Frommer's examples:<br /><br /> [b]pol 'olem peyä wutsot[/b] [i]He made his (i.e., someone else's) dinner[/i].<br /> [b]pol 'olem sneyä wutsot[/b] [i]He made his own dinner[/i].<br /><br />There was quite a bit of discussion with this. &nbsp;There are a few open questions he wanted to think about. &nbsp;First, is there other vocabulary derivable from the root [b]sno[/b]? &nbsp;Second, would [b]sno/sneyä[/b] ever be used with the first or second person pronoun? &nbsp;That is, which is better [b]oel 'olem oeyä wutsot[/b] or [b]oel 'olem sneyä wutsot[/b]? — some languages favor the first pattern, some the second. &nbsp;Frommer seemed suspicious of using [b]sno[/b] with anything but the third person (&quot;his/her/their own&quot;), but he made some notes to himself about it. &nbsp;Stick with [b]oel 'olem oeyä wutsot[/b] for now.

<h4>Taronyu</h4>
I have two new words to announce. :)<br /><br />[b]sä[u]zä[/u]rìp: n. pa'li lead, rein (RL, PF)[/b]<br /><br />[img]http://www.pandorapedia.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/508x284/direhorse_lead_1.jpg[/img]<br /><br /><br />[b]ì[u]pxa[/u]: n. fern (RL, PF)[/b]<br /><br />[img]http://gardenblog.projo.com/5-19-fern-in-bright-light.jpg[/img]<br /><br /><br />Säzärìp comes from a suggestion I made for the lead, back when I was trying to change the ASG words into something legal. Ìpxa, though, has a much more cool history. See here:<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]Thinking about it more, I like that form because it illustrates a diachronic phonetic change we haven’t yet seen: ay à a . (This is assuming the origin of the word involved hì’i + pxay, which seems reasonable, given the “small” and “many” qualities of ferns that you mentioned, Prrton.)<br /><br />ay à a ( or a: ), including in word-final position, is attested in many languages. In certain kinds of Southern American English, for example, you have “I” and “my” pronounced “ah” and “mah” respectively. And my paternal grandmother, in her non-standard Galician Yiddish, pronounced the standard word [haynt] ‘today’ as [ha:nt].<br /> <br />Plus ìpxa preserves the beer/phonetics origin more clearly than ìpxay.[/quote]<br /><br />As far as the etymology for fern goes, it comes from two things: the IPA, which is the International Phonetics Alphabet (I use it in the Dictionary.) The other etyma is a beer:<br /><br />[img]http://thefullpint.com/main/logos/russianriver.gif[/img]<br /><br />Pawl and I both had an IPA draught of this - IPA stands for India Pale Ale. And there you have it. I had said earlier that I like ejectives, and that I wanted a word for 'fern', and that it ought to start with 'ì' because so little words do. When Pawl heard me order a drink, the word was suggested. Best etymology ever. :D<br /><br />

[b]Txantsan nang[/b] Both terms are really cool. I like the ä sound. And as a student of biology, I appreciate it any time we get new botanical/zoological terms.<br /><br />It makes me wonder though, if there aren't plant types on Pandora that cannot be properly described with our terms for plants (a fern is something very specific). Specifically, I wonder if there is anything similar there to an `Rrta 'orchid'.

<h2 id="130">Sì'eyng a ftu Na'rìng #2: The rest of the Top 7</h2>
<h4>Lance R. Casey</h4>
Here follow the answers to the rest of the &quot;Top 7&quot; of the [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/navi-language-workshop-the-poll-of-outstanding-questions/]Outstanding Questions[/url], as numbered in the PDF accessible [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/navi-language-workshop-the-poll-of-outstanding-questions/msg313139/#msg313139]here[/url]. (Frommerian examples are here marked with [color=blue]blue[/color].)<br /><br /><br />[b]Asking/giving permission (#5)[/b]<br /><br />As suggested, [b]tsun[/b] can work for both. So, for example:<br /><br />\	[b]– Tsun oe kivä srak?[/b]<br />\	[b]– Srane, nga tsun kivä.[/b]<br /><br />It is also possible that [b]tung[/b] [i]allow[/i] might be used in such cases, but the details of that, including the full syntactic environment of the verb itself, are under consideration, so just stick to [b]tsun[/b] for now.<br /><br /><br />[b]Phonological questions (#6a)[/b]<br /><br />[list]<br />[li]Final stops are released if followed by a vowel in the flow of speech (i.e. not at the end of sentences, before pauses etc.). In other words, the underlined [b]t[/b] would be released in sentence #1 below, but not in #2:<br /><br />\	1. [b]Po[u]t[/u] oel tse'a.[/b]<br />\	2. [b]Oel tse'a yeriki[u]t[/u]. Oeru tìng oeyä tskot.[/b]<br /><br />[/li]<br />[li]The sequence [b]äa[/b] is allowed and does not decay (e.g. [b]kinäa zìsìt[/b] [i]seven years[/i]). The reverse [b]aä[/b] is more unlikely to occur since the genitive suffix for words ending in [b]a[/b] is [b]-yä[/b], but it would also be fine. Also, from the infixed verb [b][color=blue]veykrre[u]iyì[/u]n[/color][/b] [i]cause to be overwhelmed (woo!)[/i] in a [url=http://naviteri.org/2010/09/getting-to-know-you-part-3/]recent Na'viteri post[/url], [b]*iì[/b] is apparently unstable enough to be prevented.[/li]<br />[li]Na'vi does not have double or long vowels naturally, but they can arise as the result of affixing. In writing, this is marked with a hyphen: [b]oe-eo[/b] [i]before me[/i], [b]zekwä-äo[/b] [i]under the finger[/i], [b]fya'o-o[/b] [i]some way[/i][/li]<br />[li]In the known phrase [b][color=blue]fìskxawngìri tsap'alute sengi oe[/color][/b], the form of the auxiliary verb [b]si[/b] is not an error, but a variant. Specifically, when the pejorative affect infix [b]‹äng›[/b] is followed by the vowel [b]i[/b], it may (NB: not must) be shifted to [b]‹eng›[/b].[/li]<br />[/list]<br /><br /><br />[b]Synonyms (#6b)[/b]<br /><br />For the five provided examples, we got this:<br /><br />[list]<br />[li][b]na[/b] vs. [b]pxel[/b] (like, as): These are synonyms, but [b]na[/b] is more common.[/li]<br />[li][b]hawnu[/b] vs. [b]tìhawnu si[/b] (protect): The difference between these is one of syntax, not semantics. That is, they mean the same, but are used differently in a sentence: the first is a transitive verb, whereas the second, being a [b]si[/b]-construction, is treated as intransitive with the recipient of the action in the dative case.[/li]<br />[li][b]nìn[/b] vs. [b]tìng nari[/b] (look): [b]Nìn[/b] is a transitive verb that is typically used with a direct object: &quot;look at&quot;, but not with the ongoing connotation of &quot;watch&quot;; more &quot;turn your attention to that right now&quot;. [b]Tìng nari[/b] is intransitive as per above. Also, for a simple &quot;look at that&quot;, [color=blue][b]tsat nìn[/b] would be more likely than [b]tsaru tìng nari[/b] (and it's shorter too)[/color].[/li]<br />[li][b]way[/b] vs. [b]tìrol[/b] (song): [b]Way[/b] refers to ancient or ceremonial songs, whereas [b]tìrol[/b] is more general, but it only refers to vocal songs, not instrumental ones, as one might expect from the derivation ([b]rol[/b] [i]sing[/i]). We also got a tentative yes on the verb [b]way si[/b], which would be to &quot;sing a [b]way[/b]&quot;.[/li]<br />[li][b]kin[/b] vs. [b]X-ru lu tìkin[/b] (need): Here there is a clear division of meaning and use. [b]Kin[/b] is a transitive verb that is used to say &quot;I need this thing&quot;, whereas the dative construction with [b]tìkin[/b] is used for &quot;I need to do this&quot;. Examples:<br /><br />\	[b]Oel kin syuvet fte rivey[/b] [i]I need food to live[/i]<br />\	[color=blue][b]Awngaru lu tìkin a nume nì'ul[/b][/color] [i]We need to learn more[/i] ([color=blue]&quot;We have the need. What need? The learning-more need.&quot;[/color])<br /><br />So, to say &quot;X needs to Y&quot;, use the pattern [b]X-ru lu tìkin a Y[/b]. If X is omitted, the sentence becomes impersonal (&quot;there is a need that I finish cooking by 5 PM&quot;).[/li][/list]

It's just my idea. I've analyzed all last changes and I think the common rule of infix position may be thus:<br /><br />[b]If the verb have two or more syllables, there can change only those syllables which came from verb root(s).[/b] <br /><br />For example, the verb [b]tsunslu[/b] consists two syllables which are verb roots [b]tsun[/b] and [b]slu[/b] (both are verbs). So we may put infixes in the both syllables. But the verb [b]pänutìng[/b] consists one verb root [b]tìng[/b] and noun root [b]pänu[/b], therefore all infixes must be only in second syllable (which is verb root). Your thoughts?

Okay, so to clarify:<br /><br />When a verb is a compound, you absolutely cannot have infixes in non-verb bits.&nbsp; But when it's a compound of multiple verbs, infixes can usually go in both, but it's unpredictable.&nbsp; Kefyak?<br /><br />And as for the individual verbs...we'll wait on the document, which i believe Karyu Pawl said he's going to give to Taronyu.

I don't believe I have seen this information before.<br />What makes an orchid an orchid isn't so much specialized pollination by a specific pollinator as does certain structures in the flower that are common to all orchids, no matter how different their flowers are. Although they are the largest family of plants, orchids are technically members of the lily superfamily. And although there are orchids designed to be pollinated by just one animal (almost all insects), many orchids can be pollinated by a wide variety of animals. We see pseudocenia_equina in the film, and pa`li drinking from them. They are almost certainly not orchids. There is no picture of pandorchidus_insectoralis shown, but the description strongly suggests it could be a type of orchid in the sense we sawtute understand them.

Tam, tslolam.<br /><br />Hmm...&nbsp; I'd say it depends on how slowly you're speaking.&nbsp; The more you slow down, the less likely you are to elide things together.<br /><br />I can tell you that, for us ayskxawng at the meeting this weekend, i sometimes deliberately used the long forms of case endings to make myself more easily understood.&nbsp; It's possible more formal speech defaults to long forms.

Maybe it could be used in some kind of relative clause where you can't omit the pronoun but still want to avoid ambiguity?

I understand [b]sno[/b] as a pointer to person who commits the action. So if I'm talking about me, [b]sno[/b] is a pointer to me:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]oe kä ne kelku sneyä[/b]<br />&nbsp; [i]I go to my home[/i]<br /><br />The same is with &quot;you&quot;:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]nga kä ne kelku sneyä[/b]<br />&nbsp; [i]you go to your home[/i]<br /><br />I think there is no difference between [b]oeyä[/b]/[b]ngeyä[/b] and [b]sneyä[/b] in this case, i.e. meaning of phrases [b]oe kä ne kelku sneyä[/b] and [b]oe kä ne kelku oeyä[/b] is the same. <br /><br />Also with &quot;he/she&quot; [b]sno[/b] indicates to the same person who commits an action:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]po kä ne kelku sneyä[/b]<br />&nbsp; [i]he go to his own home[/i]<br /><br />Besides if I speak about many people ([b]fo[/b]), [b]sno[/b] indicates to everyone of them:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]fo kä ne helku sneyä[/b]<br />&nbsp; [i]they go to their own homes[/i] (everyone of them goes to his own home)<br /><br />And there would be another meaning if I use [b]feyä[/b]:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]fo kä ne helku feyä[/b]<br />&nbsp; [i]they go to their homes[/i] <br /><br />I think it means that homes are their common. <br /><br />P.S. It's just my opinion ;) Maybe I think so because the same is in other languages which I know :)

<h2 id="131">Sì'eyng a ftu Na'rìng #3: Proverbs, what we asked for, and some vocabulary</h2>
<h4>wm.annis</h4>
This post finishes out the Saturday morning session, though I've thrown in a few other details that don't go anywhere else. &nbsp;This one is more chatty, less about the details of grammar.<br /><br /><br />[b]Proverbs[/b]<br /><br />We had an extended chat about proverbs. &nbsp;Nothing was really firmly decided, but a number of points did come up.<br /><br /> 1. They should reflect the culture.<br /> 2. They should be useful in everyday situations.<br /> 3. The [i]form[/i] matters, too. &nbsp;He gave the example of a Persian proverb, &quot;everything that's round is not a walnut,&quot; which sounds better in Persian because the words for &quot;round&quot; and &quot;walnut&quot; sound similar. &nbsp;&quot;All that glitters is not gold&quot; is similar.<br /> 4. It's possible some proverbs will not be obviously interpretable just based on the words. &nbsp;For an English example, think of &quot;Speak of the Devil.&quot; &nbsp;It's not even the complete phrase. &nbsp;We can expect cultural background to shorten proverbs over time to their essence, which may not be clear if you don't know the back story.<br /><br /><br />[b]What We Want[/b]<br /><br />Before lunch we went quickly around the room and people said what they most wanted from Paul. &nbsp;Many people said one thing: words. &nbsp;And not just new words, but help us understand existing words better (we don't have example of usage for plenty of them, still). &nbsp;But a few other things did come up, both in this session and in later discussions. &nbsp;Many people wanted more beginning material, as well as more audio material suited to beginners.<br /><br />Later in the day, he asked us if we wanted more but smaller blog posts or big, juicy blog posts. &nbsp;Everyone wanted more short ones, which was news to him. &nbsp;I suspect most of us would rather get one new nugget every few days. &nbsp;These would probably be easier for him to write, and it gives the rest of us more manageable chunks to learn.<br /><br /><br />[b]A few Words[/b]<br /><br />Some vocabulary matters that came up over the weekend —<br /><br /> [b]sa'sem[/b] means parent[i]s[/i], never one parent<br /> [b]Eo Eywa oe 'ia[/b] &quot;I lose myself before Eywa,&quot; a chant in the film&nbsp; (Fixed)<br /> [b]nìhay[/b] &quot;next&quot; (adverb, as in, &quot;next we will talk about verbs&quot;)<br /> [b]nìnäk[/b] &quot;by/through drinking&quot; — any liquid, not just booze<br /> [b]tìlen[/b] (n) &quot;event, happening&quot; whether planned or accidental<br /><br />There are a few others, but we're waiting on confirmation of some details.<br /><br /><br />I should mention, we currently have the weekend divided into nine sections. &nbsp;So, six more posts to go. &nbsp;They'll have more grammatical detail than this post has had.

Thanks, ma William :D<br /><br />I have one question about [b]ke[/b]. As we know, before nouns (and probably before pronouns too?) we must use [b]kea[/b] instead of just [b]ke[/b], right? But why here is [b]ke fratawtute[/b]? Maybe it should be [b]kea fratawtute[/b]? Or this means [b][ke fra-] tawtute[/b] like in english &quot;not all&quot;, i.e. [b]ke[/b] is related to prefix [b]fra-[/b] which is not noun and therefore we must use [b]ke[/b]?

[b][u]Counterfactuals[/u][/b]<br /><br />In English we have if/then statements:<br /><br />If you hunt, then we will have food.<br /><br />In English the condition (the “if” part) is in the present tense, and the consequent (the “then” part) is in the future tense.<br /><br />Na’vi uses [b]txo[/b] and [b]tsakrr[/b]:<br /><br />[b]Txo nga tivaron, tsakrr layu moeru syuve.[/b]<br /><br />In Na’vi, the condition is in the subjunctive (&lt;iv&gt;) and the consequent in the future (&lt;ay&gt;) or near future (&lt;ìy&gt;); e.g., [b]pxan livu txo nì’aw oe ngari / Tsakrr nga Na’viru yomtìyìng[/b], from the Hunt Song.&nbsp; But we also have the example, [b]Txo new nga rivey, oehu![/b] (“[ Come ] with me if you want to live”).&nbsp; So, it’s possible the subjunctive is optional.<br /><br />Just as English sometimes omits “then,” Na’vi often omits [b]tsakrr[/b]:<br /><br />If you hunt, we will have food.<br />[b]Txo nga tivaron, layu moeru syuve.[/b]<br /><br />You can also reverse the clause order:<br /><br />We will have food if you hunt.<br />[b]Layu moeru syuve txo nga tivaron.[/b]<br /><br />But some if/then statements are counterfactuals—that is, they reference a state of affairs other than what actually is:<br /><br />If you hunted, we would have food.<br />(i.e., but you didn’t hunt, so we don’t have food)<br /><br />We do not yet know how to handle these in Na’vi.&nbsp; But Karyu Pawl is thinking that there will be a new pair of words that function like [b]txo/tsakrr[/b], used exclusively for counterfactual statements.&nbsp; We also are waiting to see how the verbs will behave in these situations.<br /><br />[b][u]sä-[/u][/b]<br /><br />The prefix sä- is [u]not[/u] productive—that is, you can’t go applying it to any word you want.&nbsp; But on the words that use it, sä- plays an “instrumental” role:&nbsp; A [b]säspxin[/b] is the instrument by which one becomes [b]spxin[/b]; a [b]säfpìl[/b] is how a person [b]fpìl[/b]; etc.<br /><br />[b][u]pe+/-pe[/u][/b]<br /><br />We have question words like [b]pesu/tupe[/b], [b]peseng/tsengpe[/b]; we now know that pe+/-pe can be used freely to mean “which/what”:<br /><br />[b]Pa’lipe lu ngaru?[/b]<br />Which direhorse is yours?<br /><br />[b]Peikranit tsìme’a oel?[/b]<br />Which banshee did i just see?<br /><br />Note that pe+/-pe does not change the stress of a word (there had been some conflicting information on this earlier)<br /><br />So, [b]pe+ lì’u[/b] &gt; [b]pe[u]lì[/u]’u/[u]lì[/u]’upe[/b]<br /><br />We also now know that pe+ and the plural prefix ay+ can combine and become pay+.<br /><br />[b]Payswizawit mìyunge ngal?[/b]<br />Which arrows are you going to take?

The first one to me seems to communicate more clearly what I think Kì'eyawn is trying to say, e.g. 'I see people, but not all of them'. The second statement is easier to 'decode', but doesn't seem to convey the meaning as clearly. The second statement also lacks the double negative, which is something I still don't really understand.<br /><br />Maybe my thinking and approach to Na`vi is a bit different for others who find the second sentence a better choice. I wonder then, if this isn't an insight as to why I am not yet grasping some important principle (that, for instance, has been hindering me in writing good sentences) about this language.<br /><br />The sìltsan vs lefpom distinction is very useful. irayo!<br /><br />Finally, what is 'mirative'?

<h4>Prrton</h4>
[font=Candara][size=11pt][b](1) A couple of clarifications on on stress.[/b]<br /><br />[b]Tuté[/b]<br /><br />We’ve known for a long time that the difference between the word [b][u]tu[/u]te[/b] (person) and [b]tu[u]te[/u][/b] (woman) is the stress on the first syllable vs. the second. Normally Na’vi does not use any accent marks or other diacritics than [b]ì[/b] and [b]ä[/b] to distinguish these sounds fundamentally from [b]i[/b] and [b]a[/b]. But K. Pawl has officially recognized the spelling [b]tuté[/b] for “woman”.<br /><br />[b]Alo[/b]<br /><br />Until the Language Workshop we’ve had the word [b]alo[/b] (time, turn, instance, one of a number of repeated or recurring actions) stressed on the 2nd syllable as [b]a[u]lo[/u][/b]. K. Pawl has now corrected this to [b][u]a[/u]lo[/b]. This is more consistent with how it behaves in the words [b][u]’aw[/u]lo[/b], [b][u]me[/u]lo[/b], [b][u]pxe[/u]lo[/b], [b]ha[u]ya[/u]lo[/b], etc.<br /><br />[b](2) Word Order with Slu[/b]<br /><br />Because of Na’vi’s flexible word order, it is possible to create sentences like [b]Taronyu slu tsamsiyu.[/b] It can be unclear which noun became which if enough context is lacking or the situation is complicated. In a case like [b]Po slu tsamsiyu.[/b], the speaker and listener(s) already know who [b]po[/b] is. If they did not, there would be no pronoun in play. There is no ambiguity in this scenario. But if you have any lack of clarity about the meaning, you can frame the outcome of [b]slu[/b] with [b]ne[/b].<br /><br /> &nbsp;[b]Taronyu slu ne tsamsiyu.[/b]<br /> &nbsp;The hunter becomes a warrior.<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; or<br /><br /> &nbsp;[b]Ne taronyu slu tsamsiyu.[/b]<br /> &nbsp;The warrior becomes a hunter.<br /><br />[b]Ne[/b] is the regular directional adposition. We’re already familiar with it. Now its role has be metaphorically extended for this grammatical construct (specifically with [b]slu[/b]). It can be used before or after the predicate, which is the ‘outcome’ of the the becoming. [b]Taronyune slu tsamsiyu.[/b] is also a valid way to say “The warrior becomes a hunter.”<br /><br />[b](3) To be “about to” to do something... intention in the past.[/b]<br /><br />Much has been asked and said about [b]-ìmìy-[/b] already. It occurs once in the film dialog when Neytiri is justifying to Eytukan why she brought Jake to the Hometree. She intended to kill him when she first saw him in the forest, but then held back when there was a sign from Eywa (the atokirina’ touching her arrowhead.) It was revealed during the Workshop that this combination of [b]-ìm- + -ìy-[/b] was an error. One way or the other, this is not ‘proper’ Na’vi and it should never be used by those of us who are trying to learn correct grammar.<br /><br />However, there is a valid way to say this in Na’vi. The verb [b]kan[/b] (aim) can be used modally in all tenses to express intention of the subject to do something. Neytiri’s line might better have come out:<br /><br /> &nbsp;[b]Oe pot [color=brown]k[/color]‹arm›[color=brown]an[/color] [color=brown]tsp[/color]‹iv›[color=brown]ang[/color]...[/b]<br /> &nbsp;I was intending to kill him...<br /><br />The syntax of [b]kan[/b] as a modal is like [b]new[/b], that is, either [b]kan + V‹iv›[/b] or [b]kan futa V‹iv›[/b].<br /><br /> &nbsp;[b]Oel keran futa frapo pivähem txon’ongsre.[/b]<br /> &nbsp;I intend for everyone to arrive before nightfall.<br /><br /> &nbsp;[b]Po kayan ngivop mipa pxesìrolit txo por tsun srung sivi peyä meylan.[/b]<br /> &nbsp;He will be of a mind to create 3 new songs if his two friends can help him out.<br /><br />There is also a well-known future intentional mood infix ([b]-s-[/b]) in Navi that combines with [b]-ìy-[/b] and [b]-ay-[/b] to form [b]-ìsy-[/b] and [b]-asy-[/b]. It is only relevant in the future and it expresses the speaker’s intent about his or her own upcoming actions. When a speaker uses these infixes his or her mind is made up unambiguously.<br /><br />The matter of how to express scenarios involving “about to” in the past when there is no overt intention on the part of the subject (e.g.: I was about to fall off of a cliff...) is still under consideration by K. Pawl.[/size][/font]<br /><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />&nbsp; [font=Candara]Edit: Corrected missing [b][color=brown]-l[/color][/b] on [b][color=brown]oel[/color][/b] in example above:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [b]Oe[color=brown][b]l[/b][/color] keran futa frapo pivähem txon’ongsre.[/b][/font]<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br /><br />

<h4>`Eylan Ayfalulukanä</h4>
So, could the last several posts be summarized as follows?<br /><br />The subject of a modal takes the intransitive subject, but if the verb controlled by the modal is transitive, then it (the controlled verb) can still take a normal direct object — without triggering the agentive ending on the subject of the modal. The exception to this rule is if futa is used between the modal and controlled verb.<br /><br />And if this is correct, why is it correct? What is special about futa in this regard? Or to ask this question another way, what is not special about nouns other than futa, that one might stick between a modal and its controlled verb?

<br />[b]«New»[/b] is a somewhat 'funny' verb in that it has transitive and intransitive properties in Na'vi depending on its usage.<br /><br />I believe that when it behaves modally directly with a slave verb in [b]-iv-[/b] that it is subject to the rule that it must be treated as intransitive.<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]Oe new pot tspivang.[/b]<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  or<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]Oe pot new tspivang.[/b]<br /><br />&nbsp; I want to kill him.<br /><br />I am under the impression that these are both correct. The first is MORE common, however.<br /><br />If [b]new[/b] is used with a typical nominal object, it becomes wholly transitive.<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]Oel new tsat. / Tsat new oel. / New oel tsat. / Tsat oel new. / New tsat oel.[/b]<br /><br />&nbsp; I want that.<br /><br />'That' is the object of my desire. My desire 'acts' on it directly.<br /><br />In the [b]futa[/b] construct, [b]futa[/b] behaves like a regular direct object (100% parallel to [b]tsat[/b]). So:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]Oel new futa...[/b]<br /><br />The reason that the verb goes to the subjunctive in the subordinate clause attached to the desire by [b]futa[/b] is that the 'wanter' is desirous of something (a condition or outcome) that is not yet a reality. There are probably still some open questions about the subjunctive in certain contexts that make the seem a bit blurry too.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, I took on posting this using aggregated notes. I did not personally hear and there on the spot internalize that K. Pawl said that [b]kan[/b] as a modal would mimic the behavior of [b]new[/b] [u]precisely[/u], but it does make sense to me. Both verbs, [b]new[/b] and [b]kan[/b] used modally for &quot;intend&quot;, have a relationship to the desires/motivations/intentions of the speaker. And, [b]kan[/b], in its original meaning of &quot;aim&quot; easily takes a direct object (like new).<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]Oel kan swizawit oeyä tsopìr yerikä.[/b]<br /><br />&nbsp; I aim my arrow at the yerik's lung.<br /><br />In English WANT and AIM can also be both transitive and intransitive.<br /><br />If anyone knows more about that line in the aggregated notes than I, PLEASE chime in now.<br /><br />

I don't know if it has ever been confirmed that you can mix up the order in the modal short form...&nbsp; Though we do have the dialog &quot;Pot tsun oe tspivang nìftue&quot; from Tsu'tey.&nbsp; Yet one more thing that needs to be clarified (Unless we have another example of that order, which is not entirely out of the realm of possibility.<br /><br />On some of the other comments in the thread...<br />Hawnu-yu and hawn-uy-u would both be stressed on the first syllable, so it is up to context to clear it up.<br /><br />Futa is not &quot;special&quot; really.&nbsp; It is a contraction of fì'ut a, so it has the built in patientative case, hence why it is proper to use oel with futa.

Here's my notes on &quot;Nang&quot;:<br /><br />[quote author=Ftiafpi's Notes][u]What exactly does Nang do:[/u]<br /><br />Generally, yes. Nang is a &quot;txan intensifier&quot;. Although there could be an extreme lexical item without txan that takes nang.<br /><br />Also an exclamation of surprise.<br /><br />[i]Mirativity.[/i]<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I took away that &quot;nang&quot; was used to &quot;intensify txan&quot;. I.E. &quot;Txantsan nang!&quot; &gt; &quot;Txantsan!&quot; and so on. Also, I remember Karyu Pawl mentioning that nang was also a Na'vi exclamation of surprise. If I recall correctly, from before we had &quot;nang&quot; as something similar to &quot;wow!&quot; where it was used as a positive exclamation only.<br /><br />Mirativity is from &quot;admire&quot;. It was a term that was new to Paul so I gather it's not in common usage. I think William brought it up so I'll leave it to him to explain but I think it meant that it was a word that carried with it a quality of admiration. Keep in mind this was something not brought up by Pawl so I'm not sure how applicable it is to &quot;nang&quot;.<br /><br />Edit: Wiki article: [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirative]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirative[/url]

[b]Multiple Attributive Adjectives (#23)[/b]<br /><br />During this session we spoke much of a small, pretty bird.&nbsp; The question is how to attach multiple attributives to a single noun.&nbsp; So far, our only evidence of this is to sandwich the noun between the two adjectives:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]lora yayo ahì'i[/b]<br /><br />This is still acceptable.&nbsp; If you want to either (1) put the adjectives on the same side of the noun or (2) use more than two adjectives, you break the adjectives out into an attributive clause:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]yayo a lu lor sì hì'i[/b]<br /><br />In case you all don't read the comments on Frommer's blog regularly, this related to a question I asked about a turn of phrase [url=http://naviteri.org/2010/09/getting-to-know-you-part-2/comment-page-1/#comment-321]just before the workshop[/url].&nbsp; If you want to use an adverb on an attributive adjective, it is &quot;particularly idiomatic&quot; to yank that out into an attributive clause, too:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]yayo a lor lu nìtxan[/b] [i]a very beautiful bird[/i]<br /><br />However, you can use the adverb next to the adjective so long as it doesn't intrude between the noun and the adjective, [b]yayo alor nìtxan[/b].<br /><br /><br />[b]Complex Gerund Phrases[/b]<br /><br />This session was all about the joys of eating grubs.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; The question is how to say &quot;eating [i]teylu[/i] is fun.&quot;&nbsp; In English, we can use a gerund construction, and even though a gerund is a sort of noun it can still take a direct object.&nbsp; After a great deal of discussion, it was decided to forbid arguments (subjects, direct objects) to Na'vi gerunds.&nbsp; If you need a complex gerund phrase like English &quot;eating [i]teylu[/i], you need to use a [b]fwa/a fì'u[/b] clauses:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b][color=brown]Fwa yom teylut[/color] 'o' lu.[/b] [i][color=brown]Eating teylu[/color] is fun[/i].<br /><br />But the bare gerund is still fine, too:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b][color=brown]Tìyusom[/color] 'o' lu[/b] [i][color=brown]Eating[/color] is fun.[/i]<br /><br /><br />[b]Names of Nations and Languages[/b]<br /><br />Paul prefers to use names that approximate the native name for languages and countries.&nbsp; So, [b]Sweriye[/b] for [i]Sweden[/i], rather than [b]Switìn[/b] or the like.

Irayo! tsaw srung oeru lu, ma Prrton.<br /><br />This does illustrate how the way we think about communication and language affects how we interpret things, as I had mentioned in an earlier post in this thread. For instance, I had trouble with [b]Oel kan swizawit oeyä tsopìr yerikä[/b], even if it was 'legal' and clear to you. OTOH, I had no trouble whatsoever understanding [b]Oel kan oeyä swizawit tsopìr yerikä[/b]. The third example is good, too, but the second is still the best. I suspect some of this will rub off as i gain more experience understanding things not in logical (to me) word order.

<h2 id="136">Sì'eyng a ftu Na'rìng #°10: participles, causatives and reflexives, oh my!</h2>
<h4>Tiger</h4>
On Sunday afternoon, under the lovely canopy of the forest, there was some discussion related to participles, causatives and reflexives, and how they relate to each other and some other odd situations.<br /><br />[u][b]Participles[/b][/u]<br />First, we (In the community as a general whole) have been saying for a long time that participles are pre-first. &nbsp;This all falls to a misreading of Frommer's language log post ages ago, and it is in fact not the case. &nbsp;Participle infixes (&lt;us&gt; and &lt;awn&gt;) are first position, and can not combine with any other first position infixes. &nbsp;That means there are no past, future, perfective or imperfective participles of any sort. &nbsp;(Though I'd imagine you could use attributed phrases for similar effect - [b]syuve a fkol yalmom[/b] vs. [b]yawnoma syuve[/b] [i]eaten food[/i], for example.) &nbsp;There are also no second position infixes allowed with participles. &nbsp;Pre-first position infixes can, of course, combine with participles.<br /><br />[b]smäpusona tute[/b]<br />[i]Self-knowing person[/i]<br /><br />Participles of auxiliary (si) verbs are constructed no differently than the verb is normally used - the participle infix goes into the verb part, and both parts are considered together. &nbsp;In writing, the words are hyphenated to show the connection. &nbsp;Notice the location of the attributive [b]-a-[/b] affix in the following examples.<br /><br />[b]srung-susia tute[/b]<br />[b]tute asrung-susi[/b]<br />[i]Helping person[/i]<br /><br />[b][u]Reflexive causative[/u][/b]<br />There are, then, only two pre-first position infixes, the causative and the reflexive. &nbsp;Can they combine? &nbsp;Yes, they can, in one form, &lt;äp&gt;&lt;eyk&gt; is the reflexive causative, meaning cause oneself to do something.<br /><br />[b]po t[color=blue]äp[/color][color=red]eyk[/color][color=teal]ìyev[/color]erk[color=green]ei[/color]up nìnäk[/b]<br />[i]I am jazzed that he is apparently about to drink himself to death[/i]<br />(That is officially the most mutilated a verb can become, and was a group effort. &nbsp;Color coding due to the extreme verbal mutilation.)<br /><br />For a slightly easier example...<br /><br />[b]po kllkx[color=blue]äp[/color][color=red]eyk[/color]em[/b]<br />[i]He stands himself up[/i]<br /><br />[u][b]Antipassive causatives[/b][/u]<br />We know that when a normally transitive verb is used in an antipassive manner ([b]po taron[/b] vs. [b]pol yerikit taron[/b]) the subject does not get any case markings, as if it were an intransitive verb. &nbsp;What happens, then, if you are using the causative form? &nbsp;A transitive verb and intransitive verb take the causative slightly differently, after all. &nbsp;But the verb is still transitive, so it is treated like a transitive verb. &nbsp;The person causing them to do something is still the agentive case, and the person being caused to do it is still the dative case. &nbsp;No patientive case is used.<br /><br />[b]oel poru teykaron[/b]<br />[i]I made him hunt[/i]

Is it possible that in some ways na'vi treats verbs with dative objects as transitive? That would, if I understand it correctly, explain the use of &lt;äp&gt; and &lt;awn&gt; with si verbs (the only other effect of transitives I can think of is the use of the ergative which might be better explained as being a result of the use of an accusative which would be &nbsp;in line with antipassive constructions).

That said, such a use of &lt;äp&gt; could be contradictory or at least would sit uneasily with sno (unless sno is restricted from the dative case like it presumably is with the patientive, do we have any examples of sno being used in the dative case?).

lawnu was probably a bad example. What I meant was that, if we assume that &lt;awn&gt; can also describe dative objects then, because of the &quot;lu X-DAT&quot; construction, surely &quot;lawnu&quot; would be best translated as &quot;owning&quot;.

[quote]Antipassive causatives<br />We know that when a normally transitive verb is used in an antipassive manner (po taron vs. pol yerikit taron) the subject does not get any case markings, as if it were an intransitive verb.&nbsp; What happens, then, if you are using the causative form?&nbsp; A transitive verb and intransitive verb take the causative slightly differently, after all.&nbsp; But the verb is still transitive, so it is treated like a transitive verb.&nbsp; The person causing them to do something is still the agentive case, and the person being caused to do it is still the dative case.&nbsp; No patientive case is used.<br /><br />oel poru teykaron<br />I made him hunt[/quote]<br /><br />Do we know how this sentence would change if I also said what he hunts, e.g. &quot;I made him hunt a palulukan?&quot;

<h2 id="137">Notation Change for Cases</h2>
<h4>Taronyu</h4>
Wm Annis' document has brought into the public forum a question that has been sort of hanging around for a while, but no one seemed to talk about it. Perhaps it got brought up here and there, but nothing really changed as a whole. Well, in the past few weeks Wm Annis' grammar, my dictionary, and now Na'vi in a Nutshell have changed, and I think it'd be a good idea if we let people know why instead of just having it happen. <br /><br />I'm talking of course about the terms [b]Nominative, Accusative, Ergative, Absolutive[/b] and the corresponding terms [b]Subjective, Patientive, Agentive[/b]. We now are no longer using the former terms, but are relying exclusively on the second. It would be great if, as a site, we all moved over in a notation. <br /><br />Here's why. Ergativity isn't really what's going on in Na'vi. We've been saying it is, for ages, but that's not really the case. It works for the Basque system, though. If they were applicable, Na'vi would look like this:<br /><br />Oe-l hahaw. I sleep.<br />Oe-t tspang yerik-ìl. I kill the yerik.<br /><br />As you can see, the subject in intransitive and the object in transitive share the same ending, while the subject in transitive changes to something else. The absolutive marker is here the -l. The -t is technically the ergative. These terms haven't really been used properly, which may have been fairly confusing for new learners, although we have managed to use the Latinate terms nominative and accusative to express what is going on fairly well.<br /><br />But this is not how Na'vi is. Agentive, Patientive, and Subjective are the standard terms that ought to be applied to Na'vi. Each is different. So:<br /><br />Oe-(0) hahaw. I sleep. <br />Oe-l tspang yerik-it. I kill the yerik.<br /><br />You'll see there's zero marking on the noun in the intranstive. So, it comes out as just Oe tspang. I don't think any of us have any problem with this, but we might have problem with calling this the Subjective case, which is technically what it is. The -l then marks agentive - as it is the agent which performs the action (not technically correct semantic notation, but that's where agentive derives from, which is not a syntactic case (If you don't understand this, don't worry.)) The object takes the patientive case, -it. And this is how Na'vi works, as we know, and now we should have the correct terms to apply to it. So, I think, from here on out: Ergative, Nominative, Accusative, and Absolutive should be stricken from our vocabulary concerning Na'vi. (Unless we're talking to people who have learned, say, Spanish.) We now have three terms: Agentive, Patientive, Subjective. Right.<br /><br />I hope this clarifies things. I posted it here because this is probably the best place for it. <br /><br />Edit: made the 'fake' example correct in terminology. Even I don't fully have ergativity internalised.

I'm Ftiafpi and I approve this message.<br /><br />*ahem* Being serious now, this is good. To me even the terminology seems to make more sense. It may just be me but agentive seems to be more obvious in it's use than ergative (which has no clear latin root that I can see).<br /><br />Oh, and what are the glossed abbreviations for reference?

This is the last of the updates from the workshop.&nbsp; I hope to have a major update to the reference grammar ready in a day or two, with everything new in it.&nbsp; It's possible we'll get a few updates from Frommer about a few of these posts, but the major work is done.<br /><br /><br />[b]Nìtengfya and Tengfya[/b] <br />These words are not identical.&nbsp; [b]Tengfya[/b] is more about situational similarity:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]Sunu oeru teylu tengfya sunu por fkxen[/b] [i]Just as I like teylu, he likes fkxen.[/i]<br /><br />But [b]nìtengfya[/b] concentrates on some action being performed in the same way:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]Po sì oe tìkangkem soli nìtengfya[/b] [i]she and I did it in the same way.[/i]<br /><br /><br />[b]Gender[/b]<br />First, [b]Olo'eyktan[/b] is not a [i]male[/i] leader.&nbsp; Paul reiterated that the sex suffixes [b]-e[/b] and [b]-an[/b] are not productive.<br /><br />On the grammar side of things, [b]poe[/b] and [b]poan[/b] cannot be pluralized.&nbsp; Use [b](ay)fo[/b].<br /><br /><br />[b]Modals and Infixes (#27)[/b]<br />When using modals with controlled verbs, only the modals get tense and aspect marking.&nbsp; The controlled verb will only get the pre-first infixes (causative, reflexive), and of course the subjunctive.<br /><br /><br />[b]&quot;He made me want to make you eat teylu&quot;[/b]<br />I was not present for this, but some mad genius asked Paul how to say, &quot;he made me want to make you eat teylu&quot; —&nbsp;[i]using only infixes[/i].&nbsp; I would loved to have seen Paul's face.&nbsp; It turns out, you cannot do this using only infixes.&nbsp; Here is the chain of development:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]Pol oeru teyluti yeykolom[/b]&nbsp; [i]He made me eat teylu[/i].<br />&nbsp; [b]Pol oeru neykew futa oel yivom teyluti[/b]&nbsp; [i]He made me want to eat teylu.[/i]<br />&nbsp; [b]Pol oeru neykew futa oel ngaru yeykivom teyluti[/b] [i]He made me want to make you eat teylu.[/i]<br /><br />At least now we know how to deal with causatives of [b]new[/b].

What was absolutive? I never used that one.<br /><br />And I do indeed find the new words confusing - subjective sounds to me like it should be a transitive verb (as it is the subject, as opposed to the object...), and patientive also seems to make little sense to me (the one who waits for something? hrh). I'll try to use the new terms, however - but I'm the sort of person who can't change their ways when they have learnt something.

Think of it like this:<br /><br />Subject - The person who is the subject, but who isn't doing anything. (Intransitive)<br /><br />Agentive - the Agent. The one who goes around doing the verb.<br /><br />Patientive - The patient, lying on the table, on whom the operation is performed. The object.<br /><br />Make sense?

<h4>roger</h4>
I agree that &quot;subjective case&quot; is misleading, as it implies that it marks the subject: in other words, the nominative, which Na'vi does not have. The normal linguistic term for this is &quot;intransitive case&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;Agentive case&quot; and &quot;patientive case&quot; are normally used for split- or fluid-S systems, where intransitives may be either AGT or PAT depending on factors such as control or volition. That's not what Na'vi has. The normal linguistic terms for an A-only case is &quot;ergative&quot;, and of a P-only case &quot;accusative&quot;. Tripartite languages are ergative-accusative-intransitive. True, they're not called &quot;ergative languages&quot;, because that is short for ergative-absolutive. But then, that's why we have the term &quot;tripartite&quot;. <br /><br />It's fine to have an in-house convention where we arbitrarily change linguistic terminology (we could call /ts/ a &quot;diphthong&quot; if we wanted), but at the price of being incompatible with the rest of linguistics.

I'm not sure it's as incompatible as all that. I'm not highly researched into ergative systems, however. <br /><br />I'm also not sure that the normal linguistic terms are as set-in-stone as that. <br /><br />So, you vote we change back, then?

I should really look all this stuff up and come to my own conclusion.<br /><br /><br />But since there seems to be doubt for now, and I happen to dislike the new terms, I'll use Nominative/Ergative/Accusative until further notice.

Thus:<br />[b]Sutel a nìn palulukanä narit ye`rìn tsìye'a Eywat[/b]<br />The idea here is looking most predators in the eye (including a thanator, I assume) is considered a threat action, and a thanator will have no trouble 'neutralizing' (and having a snack at the same time) a typical Na`vi tute.<br /><br /> And for nìTsìng Lekinama Yayo<br />[quote author=nìTsìng Lekinama Yayo link=topic=7660.msg348559#msg348559 date=1289786219]<br />Something like this has probably already been done, but I just came up with this and thought I'd get it out there:<br />[b]<br />[desc=&quot;A rock on the tail&quot;; a pain in the butt]Tskxe mì kxetse[/desc][/b]<br /><br />Thoughts? &nbsp;:D<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Why not just [desc=Pain in the butt][b]Tìsraw mì tìm[/b][/desc]?

I'd say same way you cite a special feature on a disk. It's accessed through the menus just like any other stuff, there's just an additional menu item that appears when it has internet access and it lets you select from more videos online.

The context of the lessons is that they (Zoë, Laz, and Wes) are practicing (with Carla, not Paul) and it was a long time ago. That's another reason to consider it pseudo-canon. But, Zoë and Laz were in mo-cap gear, so it was after shooting had started. I think it was the first time that Wes was seeing his lines. Zoë and Laz were pretty good at it already.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Well for one yom isn't a noun...<br /><br />But yeah given his explanation of why yomtìng is intransitive, that does make it odd that pänutìng is transitive.&nbsp; And THAT would be a good question.

Agreed - I'll also add that [desc=(as it's called on most of the forums that I am on, which I prefer because it doesn't invent stupid words)]thread resurrection[/desc] quite often leads to more people not checking the date (because it's at the top of the list), which in turns lead to pointless discussions with people correcting things the original poster said - except that they said them back when those things were thought to be true, so it's really superfluous and irritating.<br /><br />By all means, resurrect a thread if you have something substantial to add - but not just to show your agreement to a post, for example.

It &quot;caught on quick&quot; because it is the only form that we have ever had from Frommer.&nbsp; While he did explain how iyev became ìyev, he has never really given the &quot;kiyevame&quot; form.&nbsp; And really it's not like it's hard to pronounce it as kìyevame, especially if you take the laxing of i-&gt;ì as almost turning into a schwa as I suspect is the intent here.&nbsp; (Frommer has stated in an email to me that he thinks in unstressed syllables, ì can tend towards a schwa.)&nbsp; Along with that, I imagine there is perhaps even a weakening of the y so it becomes more of a ì approximate than an i approximate.

<h4>wm.annis</h4>
After two discussions recently on the forums ([url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/vocab-phrases/re-ma/][1][/url], [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/advanced-grammar/as-adj-as/][2][/url]), I decided to tack on two questions to some email to Frommer about the Vocabulary Committee.&nbsp; After a few days of meditation and discussion...<br /><br />[b]As ADJ/ADV as N/PRN[/b]<br />For this he decided to create a modification of [b]fìtxan[/b] — [b]nìftxan[/b], which works with [b]na[/b]:<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]<br />[b]Oe lu nìftxan sìltsan na nga.[/b]<br /><br />I’d also like to allow an optional [b]–ri[/b] form in place of [b]na[/b]:<br /><br />[b]Ngari lu oe nìftxan sìltsan.[/b]<br /><br />That wouldn’t work all the time. For example:<br /><br />[b]?Utralìri lu fìpo nìftxan tsawl.[/b]<br /><br />That places too much emphasis on [b]utral[/b], which is only the standard of comparison and presumably hasn’t yet figured into the conversation. In this case [b]na utral[/b] would be preferable.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I asked for clarification about the use of the topical, &quot;So, nìftxan...na... always possible, with a topical point of comparison for old information (pronouns, discourse topics we've already seen that for some reason we want to use as a point of comparison)?&quot;&nbsp; His answer, &quot;Correct.&quot;<br /><br />We can also use this construction with adverbs.<br /><br /><br />[b]The Continuative: Keep on Keepin' on[/b]<br />After discussion involving both Tirea Aean's suggestion of [b]salew[/b], and Frommer's own preference for [b]'ì'awn[/b], a follow-up question from me about states (grammatically speaking) led him to create a new verb, [b]var[/b]:<br /><br />[quote=Frommer]I've been thinking about this for a while, and I've decided to go with a new verb, [b]var[/b]. As a main verb it means 'to persist in a state, to continue to perform an action.' As such, it can take the place of [b]mi[/b] with a repeated verb. For example, instead of this:<br /><br />-[b]Pol trram yerikit tarmaron[/b]. '[i]He was hunting hexapede yesterday[/i].'<br />-[b]Fìtrr mi teraron[/b]. '[i]He's still hunting (hexapede) today[/i].'<br /><br />you could simply say:<br /><br />-[b]Pol trram yerikit tarmaron[/b]. '[i]He was hunting hexapede yesterday[/i].'<br />-[b]Fìtrr var[/b]. '[i]He still is today[/i].'<br /><br />As a helping verb, it functions in place of salew/'ì'awn that we discussed earlier:<br /><br />[b]Var nivume ko[/b]! '[i]Let's keep learning![/i]'<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Na'vi has interesting kinds of anaphora.&nbsp; In any case, var nivume ko!

Cool!&nbsp; So, would you also use [b]var[/b] for something that conveys, &quot;I have been doing X since yesterday&quot;?&nbsp; How would you do that?<br /><br />(P.S., i'm guessing &quot;since&quot; ultimately will come from a word that functions as the opposite of [b]vay(krr?)[/b], but i dunno).

So linguistically, [b]var[/b] is an anaphoric verb, but because of its propensity to be used as a helping verb would it be going too far to call it modal?

That's assuming time (krr) is even countable, which I don't think it is...&nbsp; Not all nouns are countable.&nbsp; We can have the plural of time in English (times), but what we usually mean when we say that would better be translated to Na'vi as alo, not krr.

<h4>Ataeghane</h4>
Countableness is not fixed. It's obviously diffrent in diffrent languages, and I think it's quite often a little idiomatic. For instance, in Polish 'time' is 'czas' and it's meaning is similar to English one. But plural ('czasy') means rather 'nowadays', than 'times'. (For 'alo' we use the word 'raz')

I asked Frommer what I had thought would be confirmation of a simple matter — can we use [b]ftang[/b] [i]stop[/i] with modal syntax, as we do with [b]sngä'i[/b].&nbsp; This was the answer:<br /><br />[quote=&quot;K. Pawl&quot;]<br />Well, that's an interesting question. I checked the dialog for the film and the video games, and in fact I didn't have any &quot;stop V-ing&quot; constructions. What I did have were examples of &quot;stop N&quot; (presumably, stopping the N's from V-ing, although that wasn't expressed). For &quot;stop N,&quot; I had used a si- construction:<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]ulte kawtu ke tsun ayoer tìftang sivi[/b] 'and no one can stop us'<br /><br />&nbsp; [b]Txo ke tsiyevun oe tìftang sivi for[/b] . . .&nbsp; 'If I should not succeed in stopping them . . . '<br /><br />So what to do for &quot;stop V-ing&quot;? Well, since [b]sngä'i[/b] takes modal syntax for &quot;begin to V&quot; which is the same as &quot;begin V-ing,&quot; I don't see why it shouldn't be the same for ftang. So yes, your surmise is correct.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The one thing you can't do with [b]ftang[/b] is to use it transitively: So you can't say *Oel pot ftolang, but only [b]Oe poru tìftang soli[/b]. Again, I think that's OK.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />The question of how you would say, &quot;I stop X from Ying&quot; is not yet determined.

<h4>Plumps83</h4>
[size=11pt][font=Georgia][i]Ma frapo[/i],<br /><br />I got in contact with K. Pawl the other day to ask about how to count when we would say something like “hunter (number) 3”, “I search room 5” or “welcome to program 2” etc. Irish uses a slightly different set of numbers for this altogether, so I was curious how Na’vi treated these. <br />The answer seems simple but I think worth mentioning:[/font][/size]<br /><br />[quote author=Paul Frommer, Feb 7, 2011][size=10pt]OK . . . about counting things in Na’vi:<br /><br />Actually, it’s easy. There isn’t anything exactly equivalent to “hunter number 3”—instead, you just use the ordinal (as opposed to the cardinal) numbers. (Cardinals: one, two, three, . . . ; ordinals: first, second, third, . . . ) So:<br /><br />hunter number 3 = [i]taronyu apxeyve[/i] (or, of course, [i]pxeyvea taronyu[/i])<br /><br />(If you see any problem with that system, let me know.

<h2 id="151">Definitive answers on proper nouns</h2>
<h4>tigermind</h4>
Kaltxì frapoya,<br /><br />So, largely for my own edification, i asked Karyu Pawl about how we deal with compound and otherwise &quot;complicated&quot; proper nouns. &nbsp;Specifically, i asked him (as examples) where the case markers go on &quot;Karyu Pawl&quot; and &quot;ayRam aLusìng.&quot; &nbsp;I was surprised by one of the answers, and in any case i wanted to share.<br /><br />[quote author=Karyu Pawl]<br />1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the “Karyu Pawl” + dative question: I have to admit I vacillated on this. The “hidden alu” explanation is appealing! But in the end I felt we should go with Karyu Pawlur. I agree that Karyu is acting as a kind of modifier here. So even though we would say tsataronyur alu Kamun, with titles like Karyu we should go with the case marking on the proper noun. So I’m with you on that one.<br /><br /><br />2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for the ayRam aLusìng question, I favor ayRam aLusìngit as the objective. The reason, as some people have suspected, is that ayRam aLusìng, although it originated as a N + Adj, is now a really a proper noun—a “giant noun,” as you mentioned.<br /><br />I was trying to come up with a parallel in English and couldn’t find a really apt one. The closest I’ve come is Attorney General. What’s the plural? The purists want us to say Attorneys General, but most people think of it as a compound—or giant—noun, so the plural feels more natural as Attorney Generals. (Of course that’s not truly parallel with the Na’vi case, since N + Adj is extremely rare in English.) Another possibly related example in English comes with titles of books and movies: “The Thorn Birds is an interesting film.” There we’re taking something that looks plural and treating it as a giant, singular noun. So we say is rather than are. Again, not quite the same as the Na’vi situation.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />So, there you have it. &nbsp;In cases where one noun is being used as a sort of &quot;title,&quot; the case marker goes on the proper name (so, &quot;I saw Brother Kamun&quot; would be [b]Oel tsole'a Tsmukan Kamunit[/b]—but &quot;I saw your brother Kamun&quot; would be [b]Oel tsole'a ngeyä tsmukanit alu Kamun[/b]). &nbsp;But with proper nouns in which part of the name is an adjective, the case markers go at the very end of the compound—even if that means sticking it on what's technically an adjective.<br /><br />So now you know &nbsp;;)

Kaltxì ma smuktu,<br /><br />So, after mulling it over a bit, Karyu Pawl says (with his apologies) that he's decided that ALL compound nouns will take case markers on the head noun.&nbsp; After too many questions came up, like whether to stick a second case marker on the end of [b]Utral ayMokriyä[/b], or whether [b]lì'fya leNa'vi[/b] &quot;counts&quot; as a proper, compound noun, he decided the best route was to simplify things.&nbsp; So:<br /><br />[b]Ayvitrayä Ramunong[u]it[/u]<br /><br />Utral[u]it[/u] ayMokriyä<br /><br />lì'fya[u]ti[/u] leNa'vi<br /><br />ayRam[u]it[/u] aLusìng<br /><br />eltu[u]ti[/u] lefngap[/b]<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />The case marker still goes on the name when a compound is a title-plus-name (e.g., [b]Karyu Pawl[u]it[/u][/b]); and when a proper noun is only one word—well, that ought to be obvious (e.g., [b]Kelutral[u]it[/u][/b]).<br /><br />Apologies again for the confusion while that was getting sorted out.

<h4>tigermind</h4>
Kaltxì ma smuktu,<br /><br />So, it's possible i'm one of the only people who was surprised by this.&nbsp; But i went to Karyu Pawl to ask about a sentence from one of the blog posts, and he set me straight.&nbsp; So, for the edification of anyone else who might have been confused about this like i was:<br /><br />[quote author=me]On the Jan. Part 2 post, there's this sentence:<br /><br />[b]Tsat ke tsun oe ronsrelngivop.[/b]<br /><br />I would've expected [b]Ke tsun oe [u]tsat[/u] ronsrelngivop.[/b]&nbsp; I thought the object of the second verb has to come after the modal verb...?[/quote]<br /><br />[quote author=Karyu Pawl]Word order: Remember that Na’vi word order is extremely flexible. More so than in many if not most languages, definitely including English, you can permute the order of constituents without changing the semantics of who is doing what to whom.<br /> <br />Both sentences you’ve mentioned below are fine.<br /> <br />The one that begins with tsat—that is, with the object—is perhaps more “marked” than the version you gave, with more emphasis on the object. But keep in mind that we can do the same thing in English, as in “THAT I can’t imagine!” Or: “Him I like; her I can’t stand.” Those are both object-initial sentences, which in English are stylistic variants of the more expected SVO order . . . but under certain circumstances they’re acceptable. That’s much more the case in Na’vi, where the word order rules permit lots of variation. For example, all 6 possible permutations of “Oel poti tse’a” are grammatical—which is not to say they’re interchangeable in any particular conversation.<br /> <br />So feel free to experiment with different word orders. It’s hard to go wrong in Na’vi.[/quote]<br /><br />So, apparently Na'viyä free word order is even more &quot;free&quot; than i thought!&nbsp; ;D

<h2 id="155">regarding attaching nì- to participles</h2>
<h4>tigermind</h4>
Kaltxì frapoya,<br /><br />A good number of us have developed the habit of attaching nì- to participles in order to make adverbs, based on the Frommerian word [b]nìawnomum[/b] (nì-&lt;awn&gt;omum).&nbsp; So, for example, you might see a word *nìpawneng being used to mean &quot;as told,&quot; or something to that effect.&nbsp; So, in my most recent conversation with Karyu Pawl, i asked how he felt about this.<br /><br />Regarding whether [b]nìawnomum[/b] is the basis for a productive way of using nì- with participles, the answer was an emphatic [b]NO[/b].&nbsp; He said, however, that the existence of [b]nìawnomum[/b] opens the door to the possibility that there are other words in Na'vi that are constructed the same way (i.e., nì-V&lt;awn&gt;ERB), but these will need to be explicitly listed in the dictionary, and will not be common.<br /><br />So, that means this construction is not at all productive, but [b]nìawnomum[/b] might not be the only one of these we see.

I don't think this is possible. notice what you are saying: fì'u a na, fìut a na. you can't place [b]na[/b] after this [b]a[/b] unless you want to say &quot;this thing which is like&quot;. for this you must say in my opinion &quot;na fwa&quot; and not take risks.<br />and this figure of speech is only used when the &quot;thing&quot; is a clause by itself. if you want to say just like [desc=which is not a clause]this thing[/desc] it's &quot;fì'una&quot; with no relative pronouns.

Pawl, 18 May][size=10pt]As for your other question, the general rule is that when two identical vowels come together, they coalesce into one. So in your examples, the words become fìlva, tsatan, and fnekxan respectively. Of course if the noun begins with a glottal stop, this doesn’t happen. For example, ‘this spiral’ is fì’ìheyu.[/size][/quote]<br /><br />[size=9pt]<br />edit: translation added ::)[/size]

<h2 id="158">Phonetics: what I found</h2>
<h4>lapo lesxkxawng</h4>
After talking to Karyu Pawl at the meetup he was able to answer some of my phonetics questions that have been keeping me up at night.<br /><br />[b]Prosody[/b]<br />If it's one thing the actors got right, it's the prosody. &nbsp;If you listen it's about 40/60-50/50 ratio of pitch accent/dynamic accent, so fko shouldn't lean too far in either direction[desc=for English speakers, this means: don't go too heavy with a dynamic, volume-based accent!].[/desc] &nbsp;The sound appears to be quite natural of most languages, too: high tone/volume is stressed, low tone/volume is unstressed, and there appears to really only be 2 levels of stress, unlike English, which can have 3-4 layers.<br /><br />As far as global prosody (i.e. what happens across whole phrases and sentences) goes, it seems a little undefined, to be honest. &nbsp;However I did hear that pieces of it were by design le'Ìnglìsì because of Cameron. &nbsp;What Cameron wanted is for phrases of the language to be recognizable, and that's why the global intonation sounded like it did. &nbsp;<br /><br />[b]An older dialect of Na'vi?[/b]<br />Frommer says he's pondering this, and it may or may not happen, but here are a couple of things that I do which I talked over with Paul about:<br />[list]<br />[li]The [i]oe[/i] diphthong: [nobbc]instead of shifting to [wɛ] before suffixes, and also in the word [/nobbc][i]oeyk[/i][nobbc] it is [ŏɛ̆], sometimes even something more like [ɔ̆ɛ̆] (by vowel harmony). &nbsp;Various Spanish sub-dialects do this too, and I expect it may even vary by speaker whether they have an oe diphthong or not.&nbsp; However, by assimilation, after u, aw, and ew, the [ŏɛ̆] diphthing shifts to [wɛ].[/nobbc][/li]<br />[li]K → velar H: [nobbc]Instead of shifting to [h] when leniting k, it shifts to [x]. &nbsp;A sound change that may have historically occured is that lenited k, [x], got weakened to [h]. &nbsp;Paul mentioned that this also happens in languages such as Hebrew, where the [x] is still intact.[/nobbc][/li]<br />[/list]<br /><br />It turns out we were kinda thinking on the same page that night, and what Frommer has previously described was modern Na'vi :)<br /><br />[b]To release or not to release?[/b]<br />Recently, I had observed that the 4 stops of Na'vi (p, t, k, and ') are unreleased in not only in word-final position, but [i]syllable[/i]-final position as well. &nbsp;If clarity is needed, n.k. to distinguish between [i]'ok[/i] and [i]'o'[/i], the stop may be lightly released (however you may want to be careful with releasing the glottal stop so that an extra syllable doesn't get perceived).<br /><br />

<h2 id="159">Some little bits on &quot;tut&quot;</h2>
<h4>Tiger</h4>
On Saturday I asked Karyu Pawl about the particle of continuation, &quot;tut&quot;.&nbsp; Most linguistic topics I have had no trouble researching, but that one has eluded my attempts to search for anything about it, so I wanted some clarification.&nbsp; I learned two things about it.<br /><br />1. It is modeled after the Mandarin Chinese particle &quot;ne&quot;.&nbsp; (Here's some [url=http://howtolearnchineseonline.com/tag/use-of-ne-in-chinese]information I found online[/url] later.)<br /><br />2. So far we've only seen it uses in the form of &quot;ngaru tut&quot;, but that is just because the questions it's used for are asked with &quot;nga&quot; in the dative.&nbsp; You should match the case when asking the question back.&nbsp; For example...<br /><br />A: [desc=Did you see him?]Ngal poti tsole'a srak?[/desc]<br />B: [desc=No, did you?]Kehe, ngal tut?[/desc]<br />A: [desc=Yes!]Srane![/desc]<br /><br />I did not get a chance to ask about other uses of &quot;ne&quot; in Mandarin Chinese, as at the time I did not know anything about it.&nbsp; I also did not think to ask about it being used with any noun case (Esp. genitive or topic) or with adpositions instead of noun case.

<h4>Taras</h4>
Irayo, but it was clear to me because we have almost the same thing in Russian and there cases also are matched. <br /><br />But I have a question. In Russian we could ask the question back concerning not only &quot;you&quot;, but any person. We even could ask &quot;who does?&quot; using the same construction. Is it possible in Na'vi? For example:<br /><br />A: [desc=Did you see him?]Ngal poti tsole'a srak?[/desc]<br />B: [desc=No, did you?]Kehe, ngal tut?[/desc]<br />A: [desc=No!]Kehe![/desc]<br />B: [desc=And did your brother?]Tsmukanìl ngeyä tut?[/desc]<br />A: [desc=No.]Kehe.[/desc]<br />B: [desc=But who did?]Pesul tut?[/desc]<br />A: [desc=Neytiri]Neytiril.[/desc]

<h2>Re: Some little bits on &quot;tut&quot;</h2>
<h4>Tiger</h4>
That was one of the things that I did not get to clarify, since I had no knowledge of any language with such a thing ahead of time, hence why I asked.&nbsp; However, given that such a use is possible in Mandarin, I would be surprised if it was not possible in Na'vi as well.&nbsp; I would not go so far as to make an assumption that it was.&nbsp; (In fact, the part you said was clear I thought seemed pretty clear too, but since we have not really had any word on it at all from Frommer, I just wanted to make sure that's how it worked rather than assuming.)

<h2 id="160">Learnings from the Siätllä song translations</h2>
<h4>Prrton</h4>
Tiny bit of ‘blessed’ canon from song translations from [i]Siätll[/i]…<br /><br />[b]Kxu[/b] takes [b]WÄ[/b] ››› [b]wä ku[/b] or [b]kxuwä[/b] in Na’vi instead of *[b]TA[/b] that might be incorrectly predicted by English. [b]Wan wä ku[/b] means to “hide from harm”.<br /><br />[b]Mìn[/b] does not mean to [u]turn[/u] left or right, but rather its core meaning is to rotate on an axis. K. Pawl shared that it was originally created to describe the ‘turning’ of a turret on some kind of RDA military equipment for a line that was never performed/recorded in the films.<br /><br />Direct address can happen interstitially in a sentence without affecting the sentence or being a part of it in any way. E.g. [b]Frìp frìp, ma Evitsyìp, torukä tsawla kxa.[/b] Of course, this would be more common in songs or poetry than in everyday speech.<br /><br />[b]Tompa[/b] can just ‘begin’ via [b]sngä’i[/b] without the core verb needing to be expressed in the subjunctive. Presumably that means that it can also [b]ftang[/b] and/or [b]’i’a[/b] likewise. I assume it would [b]’i’a[/b] (and not ftang), but that needs to be confirmed still.<br /><br />[b]Tsawke[/b] can [b]takuk[/b] indicating that it is [i]particularly direct and strong[/i]. CF “beating down” in English and “tompa ’eko” in Na’vi.<br /><br />“To dry something” (transitive) = [b]_________-t/it/ti sleyku ukxo[/b] (not [b]_______-r/ur/ru ukxo si[/b]).<br /><br />[b]Hì’ang tìran[/b] (indicating that there [u]may be[/u] no word for 'crawl' in Na’vi that is strongly associated with their movement the way it is in English). This was not a decision made by K. Pawl explicitly, but bugs/insects typically do not walk in English, so it's worth noting.<br /><br />The Museum was teaching a custom song during other activity periods called “Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes” (but sung to a different tune than you may be familiar with).<br /><br />Paul created the vocabulary item [b][u]’et[/u]naw[/b], ‘shoulder’ (dual [b]metnaw[/b]) for the Education department there many months ago, but there had been no ‘public release’ via his blog, etc. until Saturday and his confirmation of the new word in the singular.<br /><br />

Glad I got &quot;sleyku ukxo&quot; right in my original translation of the little bug song. It certainly seemed like the most sensible way to say it. (BTW, [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/fan-music/old-mc-donald-song/msg208067/#msg208067]here[/url], since you mentioned you couldn't find it.)<br /><br />Either way, pretty cool stuff! :)

irayo. so basically [b]tut[/b] continues the last sentence so we don't have to mention it again (or something like that).<br />example:<br />ngal poti tsole'a srak?<br />kehe, ngal [desc=replaces &quot;poti tsole'a&quot;]tut[/desc]?<br /><br />if my way of thinking is correct, then [b]tut[/b] is like &quot;do&quot; in English.<br />have you seen him?<br />no, [u]did[/u] you?<br /><br />if that's so I think we can confidently assume that it can be used with other people as well.

I'm not sure. But the lack of overlap is with the &quot;broadest&quot; sense of the semantic range of TURN in English.<br /><br />If you are in a moving vehicle and you turn left or right, the vehicle is not engaged in the the process of [b]mìn[/b] as K. Pawl described it. It is turning on an arc, not an axis. If you're flying on an [i]ikran[/i] and you turn left or right, that is also not [b]mìn[/b] as articulated to me. The animal must be in (forward) motion for the direction to change. Most ’Rrtan birds could not [b]mìn[/b] in flight, but a hummingbird effectively can. I expect that a [b]zize’[/b] could also [b]mìn[/b] while hovering, but that's a guess on my part. Note that when Jake speaks about turning in flight he uses the word BANK. Perhaps that points towards a Na’vi word we don't know yet.<br /><br />When you turn your head left or right, that IS the action of [b]mìn[/b] (and your neck is the axis). A traditional tank sitting still at an intersection would have to [b]mìn[/b] to turn. It would do that on the imaginary axis created by one of its treads moving forward while the other one moved backward. Perhaps K. Pawl felt that [b]mìn[/b] was OK for the [b]kenten[/b] because the entirety of his body does not 'spin', only his fan does. We'd have to ask him. I did not discuss the difference between [b]mìn[/b] and [b]kìm[/b] with him specifically. We only talked about the origins of [b]mìn[/b]. But the turret of a vehicle typically turns/rotates without spinning (fast and continually).<br /><br />Note that the word in Japanese used for turning a corner, etc. is [i]magaru[/i] which is also the word for &quot;bend&quot;. To &quot;turn a corner&quot; in Japanese, one &quot;bends&quot; it (transitively) to the left or to the right.<br /><br />[quote author=Blue Elf link=topic=19064.msg473730#msg473730 date=1310499974]<br />[quote author=Prrton link=topic=19064.msg473389#msg473389 date=1310429437]<br />[b]Mìn[/b] does not mean to [u]turn[/u] left or right, but rather its core meaning is to rotate on an axis.

A lot of plants do move (to follow the sun, etc) by twisting on their stem, so [b]mìn[/b] would be appropriate in many cases.<br /><br />However, the infamous SatNa`vi is now inaccurate in its [b]mìn ftär[/b] and [b]mìn skien[/b] instructions.<br /><br />A 'great circle' kind of turn like a car or an ikran would make would be a useful term. I remember long ago (before the corrent version of the LEP) suggesting a list of basic aeronautical terms that would relate to flight on an ikran or on toruk. It sounds like this list will need to have a term for turn added. I guess it is time to revisit that list.<br /><br />In any case, [b]Irayo fpì fmawn a lì`fya, ma Prrton![/b]

I am giving some thought to making my own Na`vi cues, and there is a tool available for building those cues. (The SatNa`vi drove the friend traveling with me nuts. Although for a while, he was genuinely trying to understand a few Na`vi words. At one point he told me to switch to another language. I asked him 'what language?' He said, not seriously, 'Mandarin'. Well, the Mandarin language is included, so I switched it to Mandarin. THAT was strange!)

<br />Ma Frapo,<br /><br />Let's keep in mind that [b]mìn[/b] also *could* also be used to refer to &quot;turning on an arc&quot;, but that's not its genesis. I agree that it seems that many liberties had to be and were taken to create a word like &quot;exit&quot;. I also don't believe that Taronyu consulted K. Pawl.<br /><br />By the way, here is the genesis of TURN in English:<br /><br />[font=Georgia][size=11pt]ORIGIN Old English [i]tyrnan[/i], [i]turnian[/i] (verb), from Latin [i][b]tornare[/b][/i], from [i][b]tornus[/b][/i] ‘lathe,’ from Greek [i][b]tornos[/b][/i] ‘lathe, circular movement’ ; probably reinforced in Middle English by Old French [i]turner[/i]. The noun ( Middle English ) is partly from Anglo-Norman French [i][b]tourn[/b][/i], partly from the verb.[/size][/font]<br /><br />I suggest that Language Committee take this on as a project at some point in the future to figure out if the Na’vi use this word in ways that we don't expect?; just use [b]kä[/b] for 'turning' left and 'right'?; or if they use some other verbs that are closer to 'veer, bank, curve, bend', 'hang a (left/right)' etc.; or some combination (as we do in English)?<br /><br />Turn is a word of [b]very[/b] varied meanings in English (that even covers the Na’vi sense of [b]alo[/b]):<br /><br />verb<br />1 the wheels were still turning: go around, revolve, rotate, spin, roll, circle, wheel, whirl, twirl, gyrate, swivel, pivot.<br />2 I turned and headed back: change direction, change course, make a U-turn, about-face, turn around/about; informal pull a U-ey, do a one-eighty.<br />3 the car turned the corner: go around, round, negotiate, take.<br />4 the path turned to right and left: bend, curve, wind, veer, twist, meander, snake, zigzag.<br />5 he turned his gun on Lenny: aim at, point at, level at, direct at, train on.<br />6 he turned his ankle: sprain, twist, wrench; hurt.<br />7 their honeymoon turned into a nightmare: become, develop into, turn out to be; be transformed into, metamorphose into, descend into, grow into.<br />8 Emma turned red: become, go, grow, get.<br />9 he turned the house into apartments: convert, change, transform, make; adapt, modify, rebuild, reconstruct.<br />10 I've just turned forty: reach, get to, become, hit.<br />11 she turned to politics: take up, become involved in, go into, enter, undertake.<br />12 we can now turn to another topic: move on to, go on to, proceed to, consider, attend to, address; take up, switch to.<br /><br />noun<br />1 a turn of the wheel: rotation, revolution, spin, whirl, gyration, swivel.<br />2 a turn to the left: change of direction, veer, divergence.<br />3 we're approaching the turn: bend, corner, turning, turnoff, junction, crossroads.<br />4 you'll get your turn in a minute: opportunity, chance, say; stint, time; try; informal go, shot, stab, crack.<br />5 she did me some good turns: service, deed, act; favor, kindness.<br /><br />PHRASES<br />at every turn her name seemed to come up at every turn: repeatedly, recurrently, all the time, always, constantly, again and again.<br />in turn let's consider these three points in turn: one after the other, one by one, one at a time, in succession, successively, sequentially.<br />take a turn for the better his luck took a turn for the better: improve, pick up, look up, perk up, rally, turn the corner; recover, revive.<br />take a turn for the worse even the doctors were surprised when Richie took a turn for the worse: deteriorate, worsen, decline; informal go downhill.<br />turn against after his father died, Bruce turned against his stepmother: become hostile to, take a dislike to, betray, double-cross.<br />turn away I know you're hurt, but please don't turn us away: send away, reject, rebuff, repel, cold-shoulder; informal send packing.<br />turn back just before boarding the ferry, Clint changed his mind and turned back: retrace one's steps, go back, return; retreat.<br />turn down 1 his novel was turned down: reject, refuse, decline, spurn, rebuff. 2 Pete turned the volume down: reduce, lower, decrease, lessen; muffle, mute.<br />turn in 1 he turned in his brother to the police: betray, inform on, denounce, sell out, stab someone in the back; blow the whistle on, rat on, squeal on, finger. 2 we turned in the entrance forms just in time: hand in/over/back, give in, submit, surrender, give up; deliver, return. 3 I usually turn in before 10 o'clock: go to bed, retire, go to sleep, call it a day; informal hit the hay, hit the sack.<br />turn of events she was unprepared for this turn of events: development, incident, occurrence, happening, circumstance, surprise.<br />turn of phrase a clever turn of phrase: expression, idiom, phrase, term, word, aphorism.<br />turn off 1 his so-called jokes really turn me off: put off, leave cold, repel, disgust, revolt, offend; disenchant, alienate; bore, gross out. 2 please turn off the garage lights: switch off, shut off, turn out; extinguish; deactivate; informal kill, cut, power down.<br />turn on 1 the decision turned on the law: depend on, rest on, hinge on, be contingent on, be decided by. 2 okay, I admit it—his green eyes turn me on.

Wow! I never thought one word could have so many meanings! (I have always used the word 'dress' as an example of one word with many varied meanings.)<br /><br />Under 'noun', number 1 and 2 feel more like adverbs than they do nouns.

I would have expected the final 't' to have been voiced a bot more like a 't', rather than totally like a 'd'. The 'e' is too much like 'u'. Now, I have an excuse to pull out one of those new large diaphragm condenser mikes I just got (at work) and try them out on some new SatNa`vi vocabulary!

He had free reign to change the lyrics of both of the songs to his liking. He was given translations in English and in the English the bug is walking &quot;on&quot; the trunk. Our dictionary gives [b]sìn[/b] as meaning both [b]on[/b] and [b]onto[/b], which is common in languages other than English.<br /><br />I am under the impression that [b]sìn[/b] means &quot;on&quot; in the sense of &quot;making direct contact with a surface&quot;; and that it takes on the meaning &quot;onto&quot; when a verb of directed motion is used.<br /><br />[b]Fwäkì spä sìn rìk ftu vul[/b] (onto the leaf from the branch. Contact with the leaf is the focus.) contrasted with [b]Fwäkì spä mì rìk[/b] ((up and down?) on the leaf. The leaf is the general location where the jumping happens).<br /><br />If these assumptions are wrong based on canon then we have some work to do with K. Pawl to tidy it up.<br />

I think the dictionary's definition is &quot;onto&quot; [b]and[/b] &quot;on&quot; because in English their meanings can overlap.<br />for example:<br />put the book [u]onto[/u] the shelf<br />put the book [u]on[/u] the shelf<br /><br />both mean the same.<br /><br /><br />I am aware of the fact K. Pawl agreed about that (I listened to the meeting recording), so perhaps he wanted another meaning (of the mantis climbing onto the trunk). but I think it is more likely that the original meaning was that he was already on the trunk.

Unrealizable wishes use the adverb nìrangal followed by the imperfective subjunctive to indicate an unattainable wish in the present, with the perfective subjunctive for an unattainable wish in the past. This can be expressed in English with phrases like, “if only” or “I wish,” nìrangal lirvu oeyä frrnenur lora sanhì I wish my children had pretty stars, nìrangal oel tslilvam nì’ul if only I had understood more.[/quote]<br />Navi in a Nutshell 2.8, 5.4.1:<br />[quote]<br />Tip: &nbsp;Nìrangal is used to express unattainable wishes, or at least wishes that<br />considers unattainable (If only; oh that; etc) and only takes &lt;ilv&gt; or &lt;irv&gt;. &nbsp;[/quote]<br />In our language summary (in Czech), the notice about nìrangal appeared long time before March 2011, from this time we started logging changes. It appears like something from ancient Na’vi. ;)

Nìawnomum, attainable wishes can be expressed with [i]rangal[/i].&nbsp; Also, to quote NiaN:<br /><br />[quote=NiaN Chapter 5.4][nobbc][The &lt;iv&gt; infix][/nobbc] is also used to express a wish or hope in the future:[b] ‘&lt;Iv&gt;ong Na’vi![/b] [i]Let Na’vi bloom![/i]<br />[/quote]<br /><br />The &lt;iv&gt; infix can be another way to express attainable wishes, in a more hopeful manner.<br /><br />If I'm not mistaken, [i]nìrangal[/i] implies that an event is not taking place or impossible to occur in the future or present, knowing how it can only take &lt;iv&gt;, &lt;ilv&gt; or &lt;irv&gt;.<br /><br />In English, &quot;I wish&quot; can be vague as it translates mainly as [i]rangal oe[/i] or a little less accurately [i]nìrangal[/i], but &quot;if only&quot; is much less vague, translating only as [i]nìrangal[/i].<br /><br />

<h2 id="164">Affective Obligation (zenke)</h2>
<h4>wm.annis</h4>
We know that the modal for &quot;negative obligation&quot; is [b]zenke[/b], as in [b]nga zenke kivä[/b] [i]you must not go[/i] ([url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php/Canon#Zenke][1][/url]).&nbsp; It is pretty obviously derived from [b]zene ke[/b].&nbsp; But I was curious how to cope with the 2nd position infixes, since I was uncomfortable with the idea that the [b]ke[/b] element would get an infix.&nbsp; So I asked.&nbsp; Here's what Pawl said about it,<br /><br />[quote=Karyu Pawl]<br />Zenke. Interesting question. I went back and forth on this one. But since the word is clearly from original *zeneke, there would probably also have been a form *zenängeke with a second-position infix. This one too would evolve to lose the e by syncope:<br /><br />That is: *zenängeke &gt; zenängke. [Stress remains in the first syllable.]<br /><br />In the same way: *zolenängeke &gt; zolenängke, *zayeneieke &gt; zayeneike, etc.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Note, however, that with the ceremonial [b]‹uy›[/b] and suppositional [b]‹ats›[/b] the [b]e[/b] does not go away, since the resulting syllable would be illegal, so [b]zolenuyeke[/b] and [b]zolenatseke[/b].

I asked him if my strong suspicion about the location of the topical was correct.<br /><br />[quote=Karyu Pawl]Ngaru tìyawr. The topical comes at the head of its clause. Poetic syntax, of course, is little indication of the rules for ordinary prose. &quot;I thee wed&quot; and a million other examples in English. ...<br /><br />I see where the impulse comes from to free the topical from clause-initial position, because on occasion I've been tempted to do that myself. But I've (almost) always found ways around the problem that don't violate that restriction.[/quote]

Nice ^^ thanks for the news. As for txìng for places, I hope it'd mean abandoning a place forever as opposed to just going away and coming back to it. Unless there's some more exotic way of dealing with this, because that'd be fun ^^

<h2 id="171">a poetic license and a note on adposition position</h2>
<h4>wm.annis</h4>
A few days ago I asked Pawl about a possible variation possessive word order.&nbsp; One consequence of this is that he made a very clear statement in support of something most of us have suspected but never had overt confirmation on, regarding suffixed adpositions (highlighted in maroon):<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl]So for ordinary usage I think we should star Gen Adp NP is a potential variant of Adp Gen NP and Adp NP Gen, or better, reserve it for poetry.<br /><br />As for other variants, I think we all agree that Gen NP+Adp and NP+Adp Gen are both OK? oeyä tsyokxfa and tsyokxfa oeyä?<br /><br />[color=maroon]BTW, the reason a postpositive Adp can separate a N and Adj, as in [b]fìtrrmì lestranten[/b], is by analogy with N+case Adj.[/color]<br /><br />For example, we have [b]fìtrrä letsranten[/b] 'of this important day.' I thought of a postpositive Adp (well, at least [b]mì[/b]) as a quasi-case . . . and in fact in some languages (Finnish, say?) it would actually count as a case, right? So . . .<br /><br />[b]fìtrrä letsranten[/b] ~ [b]fìtrrmì lestranten[/b][/quote]<br /><br />So, for the purposes of genitives and attributive adjectives with nouns, a suffixed adposition patterns like case.<br /><br />The question I was asking about was the possibility of a variant word order.&nbsp; I came up with it for a LEP sentence, but changed it back to something reasonable later.&nbsp; We know that [b]fa oeyä tsyokx[/b] and [b]oeyä tsyokxfa[/b] both work for &quot;with my hand.&quot;&nbsp; I wondered if [b]oeyä fa tsyokx[/b] might be possible.&nbsp; It is, sort of...<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl]I'm happy to allow your word order proposal in poetry. As you noted, we already have examples of poetic or ceremonial w.o. that one wouldn't be likely to find in conversation.[/quote]

And, to be sure, I am not trying to be a bother. I suppose I just like the uniformity of the [(f,s,ts)(C)V(C).(f,s,ts)(C)V(C)] word structure. If the first syllable in that example form ends in a consonant and the second a vowel, is it not logical that they should fuse to make a CV(C) syllable? I defer to Frommer's rule that a word ending in a consonant that is, then, followed by a vowel fuses with that vowel.<br /><br />Like in the sentence: [b]Fìtrr, oe ke tsun ivängeyk tsampongut; nì'it 'efu spxin[/b].<br />I imagine a uniform syllabification would look like this: [[i]fì.[b]'[/b]trr.[b]'[/b]o.e.ke.tsu.ni.vä.[b]'[/b]ngeyk.tsam.[b]'[/b]po.ngut.nì.[b]'[/b]'it.[b]'[/b]'e.fu.spxin[/i]]<br /><br />I am certain I am being a bit of a pest, [b]oer txoa livu[/b], but I do feel passionate about this, about Na'vi. 8)

Very good question, ma Blue Elf!<br /><br />There's the answer, but I don't guarantee you will understand, or even like the answer. I was very tired whan I wrote this, so I am not sure I worded it well.<br /><br />In English teachings in a Christian worldview, there is a definite distinction between 'soul ([b]vitra[/b]) and 'spirit' ([b]tirea[/b]). The spirit is an ever-existing part of your being that takes the same kind of form as God. It also means the embodiment of all existing entities that do not have a physical body. Thus, Blue Elf is correct in&nbsp; stating that [b]tirea[/b] term has a wider range of meaning that [b]vitra[/b].<br /><br />[b]Vitra[/b] refers to a specific part of our bring that makes us who we are. It,too exists apart from the physical entity that makes up a physical living thing. I think it gives the spirit living character, and is much more closely tied with the spirit than the body. The other way is to think of these entities is like a radio signal. The spirit&nbsp; is the carrier wave, and the soul is the information modulating the carrier. The soul and spirit are meant to always be together, yet remain separate entities. There is some significance as to why this distinction exists at all, but its origins are not really a subject to discourse on here. Suffice to say that there is a meaning for, and a use of, both of these words.

That brings up an interesting point.<br /><br />When we think of something that is 'intoxicating', we are usually thinking of an alcoholic beverage.

[b]Tseiun tivam.[/b]<br /><br />[b]Pxir lu fneswoa.[/b] Beer is a pragmatic cognate to a type of [b]swoa[/b].<br /><br />Again, I don't know if the creation and drinking of [b]swoa[/b] came out of a ceremonial context or not, but as evidenced by unrendered footage from the film, when Na’vi or humans driving avatars [u]drink[/u] [b]swoa[/b], they can [b]rou[/b] (= get drunk).<br /><br />

[quote author=`Eylan Ayfalulukanä link=topic=22395.msg551390#msg551390 date=1343354801]<br />That brings up an interesting point.<br /><br />When we think of something that is 'intoxicating', we are usually thinking of an alcoholic beverage. But perhaps there is something in the Pandoran environment that is 'intoxicating' in place of, or in addition to, alcohol. Thus in this case, 'intoxicating' is IMHO a very adequate definition of [b]swoa[/b]. <br />[/quote]<br /><br />One *could* use 'intoxicating' in a figurative sense as well:&nbsp; Her [desc=or presence]scent [/desc]was [i]intoxicating[/i]....<br /><br />No need to worry about that right now if we really DON'T have a word for 'intoxicating', [i]kefyak[/i]?

<h2 id="180">Tìrey LU muiä...</h2>
<h4>Swoka Swizaw</h4>
Well, the simply awesome has happened (for me ;D). I have wanted a word that I had thought of to become canon and here it is: [b]tìmwiä[/b]. I wrote Frommer a letter, saying:<br /><br />[b][i]Good morning, ma karyu...<br /> <br />I have a small request for a project that includes Na'vi. It's a likely tattoo design, but is missing a crucial element...a word for &quot;fairness, justice.&quot; A while back, a word was proposed, but has yet to be considered for canonization. The word was tìmwiä, utilizing the root muiä, &quot;fairness.&quot; Could this work? Also, since I didn't mention it, the idea is for the words &quot;truth and justice&quot; to encircle a Na'vi hand in a similar fashion as in the movie Boondock Saints (look it up! :P).<br /> <br />Your help is truly appreciated...irayo, ma Pawl.[/i][/b]<br /><br />Truth be told, I wasn't sure if the idea would come to fruition, but, Hell, I might...or if anyone else wants to, by all means. Anyway, Frommer wrote back:<br /><br />[b][i]Kaltxì, ma Brandon-- <br /><br />Yes, tìmwiä (tìm.WI.ä) is fine for &quot;fairness, justice.&quot; So &quot;Truth and Justice&quot; would be Tìngay sì Tìmwiä. I like that. Haven't looked up Boondock Saints yet, but I will. ;-) Best of luck with your project.<br /> <br />Paul[/i][/b]<br /><br />There you have it, a new word. And one that is a bit overdue, I think. Any derivations can come later.

I've slowly been collecting my own dictionary which has examples along with the words.&nbsp; Some day, I hope for this work to be rolled into a new and improved community dictionary system.<br /><br />In any case, I was completely unable to find a single example of [b]'e'al[/b] [i]worst[/i] in use.&nbsp; So I asked Pawl if it occurred in some dialog that didn't make it into the film.&nbsp; It had — <br /><br />[quote=Pawl]<br />GRACE<br />Please – this will only confirm their worst fears about you –<br />[b]Rutxe—ayngari fìkem feyä ’e’ala topur kangay sìyi nì’aw.[/b]<br />please about-you this their worst fears valid will-make only<br />[/quote]<br /><br />So, here we have [b]'e'al[/b] in action, and a heretofore unseen verb, [b]kangay si[/b] [i]validate, confirm.[/i]<br /><br />(He may reconfirm [b]kangay si[/b] in a blog post soon.)

<h4>Txepsiyu</h4>
The original email from Paul regarding ftärpa...<br /><br />[i]<br />OK, regarding mìn and kìm:<br /><br />Mìn is an intransitive verb meaning 'turn' or 'rotate.' So:<br /><br />Mìn ne ftärpa.<br />'Turn to the left.'<br /><br />Kunsìpìri txana tìmeyp lu tsyal a mìn.<br />'The gunship's main weakness is the rotor system.'<br /><br />Kìm is a transitive verb meaning 'spin'--i.e. spin something:<br /><br />Pol rumit kolìm.<br />'He spun the ball.'<br /><br />As you see, kìm is roughly equivalent to the causative of mìn, meykìn: to spin something is to make the thing turn.<br /><br />Hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.[/i]<br /><br /><br />EDIT: &nbsp;Correcting skiempa.&nbsp;  I need coffee.

<h2>Re: ftärpa and skiempa added to dict.</h2>
<h4>wm.annis</h4>
For background...<br /><br />This all came about because I've been tracking down canon examples for every word I can. &nbsp;When I noticed the example with [b]mìn[/b] in the community dictionary I got freaked out, because among other things, it had the word [b]ftärpa[/b] which wasn't even in that dictionary. :) &nbsp;So, I asked Pawl if it was dialog from the game, and if there were also a [b]skiempa[/b] lurking somewhere. &nbsp;He answered that it was from email to Markì in April, and then confirmed the utility of [b]skiempa[/b] (as you see in the quote from the email above).&nbsp; I then gently prodded Markì to post the info.

<h4>Plumps83</h4>
[font=Georgia][size=11pt]A few weeks back we had a discussion [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/beginners/comparison/]about comparisons[/url]. I was intrigued and asked K. Pawl about it. Here are his responses. Some of this we knew or guessed. But it’s always good to have confirmation.[/size][/font]<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl, 25 Jan][quote=me][size=10pt]We know that we can handle ‘I am as fast as you’ with the ‘A lu nìftxan ADJ na/pxel B’. Is this also possible with other verbs? E.g. [b]Oe tul nìftxan nìwin na nga[/b] ‘I run as fast as you’?[/quote]<br />[size=10pt]Yes, that’s fine. Here, [b]nìftxan[/b] is used before an ADV, not an ADJ, but that’s perfectly OK.<br /><br />[quote=me][size=11pt]Or with a transitive verb: [b]Oel yerikit taron nìftxan nìltsan na nga[/b] ‘I hunt yerik as well as you’?[/quote]<br />[size=10pt]Fine.<br /><br />[quote=me][size=11pt]The same question with unequal comparisons: Our paradigm there is ‘A to B lu ADJ’. Is this also possible with other verbs? Like [b]Oe to nga tul nìwin[/b] ‘I run faster than you’.[/quote]<br />[size=10pt]Fine.<br /><br />[quote=me][size=10pt]And if the particle [b]to[/b] behaves like [b]sì[/b], it should theoretically be possible to use it with a case ending, right? Like [b]Oel to ngal yerikit taron nìltsan[/b] ‘I hunt yerik better than you’ ?[/quote]<br />[size=10pt]That seems fine to me as well.<br /><br />[quote=me][size=10pt]With the superlative, we have examples of lu ADJ frato, N a-ADJ frato, V frato but not ADV frato. So these should be correct:<br />[b]Po lu win frato.[/b] ‘S/He is the fastest.’ (faster than all)<br />[b]Oel tsole’a fwampopit awin frato.[/b] ‘I saw the fastest Tapirus.’[/quote]<br />[size=10pt]Those are all OK.<br /><br />[quote=me][size=10pt][b]Nga oer tsranten frato.[/b] ‘You matter the most to me.’[/quote]<br />[size=10pt]Yes, that’s OK. But I’m wondering now about the “V frato” examples. Have you come across others in this category, besides tsranten? Whereas frato is freely used with all (scalable) adjectives and adverbs, I think its use with verbs should be quite restricted. For example, what would it mean to say, “Pol yerikit taron frato”? You need an adverb here, I think: “[b]Pol yerikit taron nìltsan frato[/b]”—He hunts yerik better than anyone, or, the best of all.<br /><br />[quote=me][size=10pt]Is [b]po tul nìwin frato[/b] ‘s/he runs the fastest’ also correct?[/quote]<br />[size=10pt]Sure, that’s fine.[/quote]<br /><br /><br />[font=Georgia][size=11pt]And concerning gerund formation of compound verbs. Something, I think, William also wondered about in [i]Horen Lì’fyayä[/i].<br />[quote=K. Pawl, 31 Jan][size=10pt]As to the gerund with compound verbs: good question! I hadn't given that consideration. But the answer is clear in my mind: it's [b]tìyomtusìng[/b], not *yomtìtusìng.[/quote]<br />[font=Georgia][size=11pt]So, the tì- element always comes before the whole word, the ‹us› enters wherever the first position infix is in the verb… e.g. tìpänutusìng, tìnusewomum, tìzoslusu, tì’awstengyusem.<br /><br /><br />And lastly, I don’t know how I could have forgotten that but this is a confirmation of a word that’s almost a year old. Furia oel tsat tswolänga’ oeru txoa livu nìngay.<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl][quote=me][size=10pt]I don’t know if you can provide me with a short answer whether we could use [b]kelsar[/b] (kel.SAR, from ke+l(e)sar) to mean ‘useless, in vain’?[/quote]<br />[size=10pt]Tsalì'u alu kelsar kosman lu nì'aw!

<h2 id="189">'ekxinum clarified by Tsm. Pawl</h2>
<h4>Txepsiyu</h4>
Paul, in an email to me on clarifying definition of [b]'ekxinum[/b]:<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />The trouble here is with English. Let's look at a parallel example:<br /><br />somwew<br /><br />Now as you know, som is hot, wew is cold. So somwew literally means hot-cold. So when we say somwewpe, we're asking, &quot;What's the hot-cold?&quot; In other words, what's the degree of hotness or coldness? Of course English has a nice word for that: temperature. So that's the idiomatic translation for somwew.<br /><br />'Ekxinum is exactly parallel. 'Ekxin is tight, um is loose. So 'ekxinum literally means tight-loose. When we say 'ekxinumpe, we're asking, &quot;What's the tight-loose?&quot; In other words, what's the degree of tightness or looseness? Trouble is, English doesn't have a nice word for that which would correspond to temperature. (At least I can't think of one.)<br /><br />In any event, I guess a clearer translation of 'ekxinum would be &quot;degree of tightness or looseness.&quot; In other words, where is it on the tight-loose scale?<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Adjusting in the dictionary accordingly.<br /><br />ta Markì

<h4>Prrton</h4>
<br />’Eylan Ayfalulukanä raised an interesting question [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/intermediate/honorific-third-person/msg580550/#msg580550]HERE[/url].<br /><br />I asked about it in the context of the Na’vi belief system and got this in response via e-mail today (02 April 2013):<br /><br />[i]“I've thought of the honorifics as being first and second person only, mainly for ceremonial use although they inevitably get extended to non-face-to-face contexts. I don't think the Na'vi need honorific third-person pronouns. If talking about rather than to Eywa, they can substitute [b]Nawma Sa'nok[/b] for variety. Or maybe even just [b]Sa'nok[/b] if the context is clear.” —Paul Frommer[/i]<br /><br />So there you have it. There are no 3rd person honorific pronouns. It's official. You can show respect by using the entity's name or a metaphorical title (i.e. by NOT using a pronoun).<br /><br />

I believe that this is the first official confirmation that no parallel forms to [b]ngenga[/b] and [b]ohe[/b] exist in the 3rd person. It has been a safe assumption up to this point.

<h2 id="194">Fnetxum, ke</h2>
<h4>radek.raszka</h4>
Approximately month ago there was discussion about [b]fnetxum[/b] and [b]ke [/b]in dictionary thread. As no solution was found, I asked our biggest authority, Paul. Here are his answers:<br />[quote=Blue Elf]About a month ago there was small discussion about [b]fnetxum[/b], which is defined as &quot;allergic&quot; (adjective). However we do not understand why it is adjective. Seems that words is created as [b]fne-txum[/b], literally kind/type of-poison, so base word is noun and result should be noun as well, as this is productive process.<br />Sample sentence is [b]Oeri lu X fnetxum[/b] -&gt; I'm allergic to X (but literal translation sounds strange: As for me, X is allergic. More logical would be IMHO:<br />[b]X-ri oe lu fnetxum[/b] - &gt; As for X I'm allergic)<br /><br />However, this type of sentences allows two usages:<br />X&lt;noun&gt; lu Y&lt;adjective&gt;<br />X&lt;noun&gt; lu Y&lt;noun&gt;<br />This supports idea that [b]fnetxum [/b]could be noun, with meaning like &quot;allergen (thing which causes allergy)&quot; :<br /><br />[i]Oeri lu X fnetxum[/i]. = &quot;I am allergic to X'.&quot; -&gt; As for me, X is allergen<br /><br />Our discussion lead to no result, and probably nobody else sent you question about this matter; so I dare to do this. Can you give us explanation why fnetxum is adjective and if it wouldn't be more appropriate to change it to noun?[/quote]<br />Response from Paul:<br />About fnetxum: You're absolutely right--it's not an adjective, it's a noun. The label in the dictionary is wrong. I'll notify Mark Miller about that. As you realized, fnetxum basically means &quot;kind or variety of poison,&quot; but it's also used to mean &quot;allergen.&quot; A literal translation of &quot;Oeri lu X fnetxum&quot; would be, &quot;As for me, X is an allergen,&quot; but of course a much more idiomatic translation into English is &quot;I'm allergic to X.&quot;<br /><br />[quote=Blue Elf]And one more simple question: In our community dictionary I noticed [b]ke [/b]is defined as an adverb, although IMHO it should be particle (to create negative verbs). Is it correct? This question also wasn't solved in discussion.[/quote]<br />Answer from Paul:<br />As for ke, well, I admit it's an unusual adverb. But dictionaries typically treat negative particles as adverbs. In a way, the negative element comments on or modifies the verb. If you say, for example, &quot;He does not swim,&quot; you're saying &quot;In what way does he swim? In no way at all!&quot; So we can consider [b]ke [/b]as an adverb modifying the verb. Of course it has other uses as well. Perhaps a more complete designation would be, &quot;ADV, PART.&quot; I'll think about that.<br /><br />So, another piece of knowledge we have got.

Kaltxì ma frapo.

<h2 id="196">Some news from Berlin</h2>
<h4>radek.raszka</h4>
At the Euroavatar in Berlin Plumps lead some Na'vi lessons every day and on the Thursday Paul came among us. There was question about double dative (like in well-known phrase from the movie: [b]Lu oeru aylì'u frapor[/b]) and Plumps asked if it is possible to use double dative in sentence like &quot;I wrote letter to you&quot; as there is no space for confusion. Paul agreed on this and gave us these examples:<br /><br />[b]Oe pamrel si ngar 'upxarer[/b]. -&gt; I write message to you.<br />[b]Oe pamrel soli ngaru 'upxarer san Oe zaya'u trray (sìk)[/b]. -&gt; I wrote to you message &quot;I'll come tomorrow&quot;. Note that using of [b]alu[/b] is not correct here: [i]Oe pamrel soli ngaru 'upxarer [color=red]*alu[/color] san Oe zaya'u trray[/i].<br />[b]Nga pamrel soli 'upxarer pesur?[/b] -&gt; to whom (what person) you wrote message?<br /><br />Also there was question how to say: Sun shines. Pawl said that [b]Tsawke lrrtok si[/b] is good way to express it.<br /><br />Plumps, please correct me if I screwed up something...

Awesome!<br /><br />Double dative is possible... So now my question is...<br /><br />How do you say:<br /><br />He made me make you hunt a hexapede.<br /><br />;D<br /><br />Oh! And does this mean that &quot;Oe pamrel si 'upxareru&quot; is correct now? Previously it had to be &quot;'upxareri oe pamrel si&quot; and &quot;oe pamrel si ngaru&quot; and &quot;'upxareri pamrel si oe ngaru&quot; I wonder why he changed his Mind about pamrel si being different from the rest? Simplicity and less exceptions?

I assume that it can still be used if the written thing is worth mentioning in the topic. I think Pawl said on the blog to your message that it would always mean a ‘defined’ message. The topic couldn’t mean ‘[u]a[/u] message’ – the dative can. Or so he translated it when we practiced [b]oe pamrel soli ngar ’upxarer[/b]…<br /><br />In other news…<br /><br />[x] Quite as expected, the genitive of [b]fko[/b] is [b]fkeyä[/b]<br />[x] I asked him about the range of [b]ta[/b] for the sentence ‘You may make your bow [u]from[/u] the wood of hometree’. He said, [b]ta[/b] would be fine for that.<br />[x] He liked [b]tolätxaw nìprrte’[/b] as ‘welcome back’ very much. I wasn’t sure who came up with that but I had the feeling Pawl wanted to know so that he can put it in his excel sheet. Does anybody remember who came up with that?<br />[x] He said the most natural way to form the questions for the middle voice (how does this drink taste/smell?) would be with [b]pefya[/b] / [b]fyape[/b], although he wasn’t entirely opposed to putting -[b]pe[/b]+ on the nouns (’ur, sur, zir, fahew, pam)<br />[x] For lack of a better word he used [b]kxu letokx[/b] for ‘violence’ in the radio play. Mind you, in time he may come up with a new root for that.

Some questions I managed to get quick answers from Karyu Pawl today:<br /><br />Nested causatives: (irayo ma Tirea Aean for reminding me we needed this) <br /><br />Karyu Pawl didn't have a ready answer to this question. He was opposed to anything combining &lt;eyk&gt; with fa- but liked the idea of using &lt;eyk&gt; with fwa/futa. He proposed that this would be ideal for the LEP/community to tackle by giving him a few suggestions that he can look over. <br /><br />Nì + ordinal numbers is productive up to a &quot;to be determined&quot; point. i.e. Twenty-seventh isn't used often in English.<br /><br />Fì + ay will generally turn into fay+ especially in rapid or casual speech but in formal or precise speech it may be fìay+. <br /><br />However, fra + ay will always be fray+.

He implied that he forgot about it in the film and also implied that any other honorific pronouns do not exist. I have to ask him about the sì construction mentioned in horen. Finally, he wanted to confirm if ohenga was indeed in his dictionary. <br /><br />[b]Tsala[/b] is confirmed unless otherwise stated by karyu Pawl. He didn't want to commit 100% to something without thinking a tiny bit more about it but saw nothing wrong with tsala. <br /><br />Finally, I was told that we didn't have any canonical quote or ruling on nì- being productive. If that is the case then it is confirmed that, while it is right most of the time, it is not productive.<br /><br /><br />

I talked with K. Pawl about [b]alu[/b], which has always been a source of trouble for me. He said that you can think of it as 'which is' or 'who is', [b]alu[/b] ;) very helpful in understanding how to use it. But he stopped short of thinking we needed to change the dictionary definition. He explained that thinking of it as [b]a[/b] plus [b]lu[/b] is very helpful as well.<br /><br />One item from last year, which I am not sure I have ever mentioned, is a clarification on the difference between [b]vey[/b] and [b]tsngan[/b]. [b]Vey[/b] refers to any food of animal origin (could include eggs or milk), but is primarily meant to mean 'meat'. This could of course, include fowl or fish (or insect). [b]Tsngan[/b] refers specifically to meat obtained from terrestrial animals (yerik, talioang, etc.).<br /><br />In general, there was a lot of very useful information in Pawl's '102 presentation', especially relating to conversational Na'vi. And partly as a result, a lot more Na'vi was being spoken at this meetup!

<h2 id="199">How to form negative/opposite adjectives/adverbs</h2>
<h4>radek.raszka</h4>
Recently I was solving question, how to create opposite or negative adjectives and adverbs ([url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/intermediate/creating-negativeopposite-adjectives/]in this thread[/url]). As it seemed that we do not have safe way how to do it, I asked our biggest authority and today I received reply. Paul promised to release these information also on Naviteri, but for those impatient here's short excerpt<br /><br />[quote=Paul][b]NEGATIVE ADJECTIVES[/b]<br />Here are some pairs we already know about:<br />[center][table]<br />[tr][td]teng 'same, equal'[/td] [td]keteng 'different'[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]eyawr 'correct'[/td] [td]keyawr 'incorrect'[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]tsuktswa' 'forgettable'[/td][td]ketsuktswa' 'unforgettable'[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]lesar 'useful'[/td][td]kelsar 'useless'[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]lefpomtokx 'healthy'[/td][td]kelfpomtokx 'unhealthy'[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]lekin 'necessary'[/td][td]kelkin 'unnecessary'[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]letsunslu 'possible'[/td][td]keltsun 'impossible'[/td][/tr]<br />[/table][/center]<br />So from these examples we can derive a rule:<br /><br />To form the negative of an adjective, use the negative prefix [b]ke[/b]-. Note, however, that for [b]le[/b]- adjectives, *[b]kele[/b]... &gt; [b]kel[/b]... &nbsp;There are also some idiosyncrasies: for example, [b]keltsunslu [/b]is usually reduced to simply [b]keltsun[/b]. Also, *[b]keeyawr [/b]&gt; [b]keyawr [/b]by the general rule that two identical vowels coalesce into one.<br /><br />This is a [color=red][u]productive process when there aren't separate lexical items in the dictionary[/u][/color] like the ones you pointed out: tsawl ~ hì'i, koak ~ 'ewan, etc. So there's no *ketsawl, *kehì'i, *kekoak, *ke'ewan, just as in English we don't have *unyoung, *unold, *unbig, *unsmall. <br />[/quote]<br />Now I found unsolved problem - how to form &quot;impatient&quot;? By rule: ke + lemweypey &gt; *kelmweypey. Question sent back to Paul.<br /><br />[quote=Paul][b]NEGATIVE ADVERBS[/b]<br />here too, a couple of dictionary entires point the way to the rule:<br />[center][table]<br />[tr][td]nìkelkin 'unnecessarily'[/td][/tr]<br />[tr][td]nìktungzup 'carefully, firmly'[/td][/tr]<br />[/table][/center]<br /><br />In the first example, [b]nì[/b]- is added to a [u]negative adjective[/u] to form a negative adverb.<br /><br />In the second, [b]nì[/b]- is added to a [u]negative verb[/u]: [b]nì [/b]+ ([b]ke [/b]+ tungzup). That is, &quot;in a way that doesn't drop&quot; or (in fractured English) undroppingly. :-) <br /><br />So negative adverbs generally start with [b]nì [/b]+ [b]ke[/b], since they're usually built up from [b]nì[/b]- along with a negative adjective or verb. But contractions occur. For example, [b]nì [/b]+ [b]ke [/b]usually becomes [b]nìk[/b]-, as in [b]nìktungzup[/b].<br /><br />So what would &quot;impatiently&quot; be? Well, remember that [b]maweypey [/b]is a verb meaning &quot;be patient.&quot; &quot;Be impatient&quot; is simply [b]ke maweypey[/b].<br /><br />The adverb &quot;patiently&quot; is derived this way: [b]nì [/b]+ [b]maweypey [/b]= nìmaweypey &gt; [b]nìmweypey[/b]. (The unstressed [b]a[/b] has dropped.)<br /><br />In the same way, the adverb &quot;impatiently&quot; is derived as follows: [b]nì [/b]+ [b]ke [/b]+ [b]maweypey [/b]= nìkemaweypey &gt; [b]nìkemweypey[/b]. (Again, the unstressed [b]a[/b] has dropped, which means the [b]e[/b] of [b]ke [/b]cannot drop.)[/quote]<br /><br />And that all for now, ma eylan...<br />See update here: [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/how-to-form-negativeopposite-adjectivesadverbs/15/]http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/how-to-form-negativeopposite-adjectivesadverbs/15/[/url]

And it's time for update. *Kele- &gt; kel- rule was precised:<br /><br />[quote=oe]how to create &quot;impatient&quot;?<br />we have le+maweypey &gt; lemweypey. According rules you gave me I should just add ke-, and if le- is present, it changes to kel-.<br />So, ke+lemweypey &gt; *kelmweypey, what breaks rules for syllable creation.[/quote]<br />And here's reply:<br />[quote=Paul]<br />Yes, you're right. That is an additional little detail to consider.<br />The same problem occurs in &quot;impatiently.&quot; As I mentioned yesterday, I derived that word like this:<br />[color=blue]In the same way, the adverb &quot;impatiently&quot; is derived as follows: nì + ke + maweypey = nìkemaweypey &gt; nìkemweypey. (Again, the unstressed [b]a[/b] has dropped, which means the [b]e[/b] of [b]ke[/b] cannot drop.)[/color]<br /><br />The question here is what happens to the underlying form *nìkemaweypey. There are two unstressed vowels that are eligible for dropping:<br /><br />[size=12pt]*nìk[color=red]e[/color]m[color=red]a[/color]weypey[/size]<br /><br />I feel pretty certain that as the language evolved, one or the other of these vowels would drop. But which one?<br /><br />If the e drops, we get [i]nìkmaweypey[/i].<br /><br />If the a drops, we get [i]nìkemweypey[/i].<br /><br />Either of these developments could be justified. I went with the [u]second [/u]form, which sounds more natural to me. So it's the [b]a[/b] of [b]mawey [/b]that dropped.<br /><br />The situation with the adjective form is similar.<br /><br />The underlying form is *kelemaweypey. Again, the two unstressed vowels eligible for dropping are:<br /><br />[size=12pt]*kel[color=red]e[/color]m[color=red]a[/color]weypey[/size]<br /><br />If the e drops, we get [i]kelmaweypey[/i].<br /><br />If the a drops, we get [i]kelemweypey[/i].<br /><br />Again, I went with the [u]second [/u]form. This has the advantage of giving us the nice pairs [b]lemweypey/kelemweypey[/b].<br /><br />So a more accurate form of the &quot;kele-&quot; rule is:<br />[size=12pt]<br />*kele- &gt; kel-, unless it would create an impermissible consonant cluster, in which case it remains kele-[/size].<br />[/quote]<br />So, enjoy improved rule and use it carefully!

<h4>`Eylan Ayfalulukanä</h4>
[b]Txantsan![/b] This is all really useful! So, I now understand that an unbound [b]ke[/b] is for verbs only. The enclitic form is for adjectives and adverbs. And the existence of [b]kele-[/b] or [b]kel-[/b] answers a long-standing question I have had, which is why some words, like 'impossible', is [b]keltsun[/b] and not [b]*ketsun[/b].<br /><br />This is also consistent in behavior with another discussion going on [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/vocab-phrases/short-forms/]http://forum.learnnavi.org/vocab-phrases/short-forms/[/url] , where the combination of [b]tsa-[/b] and an adposition is being discussed. Even though the two subjects are not related, we see a lot of interesting things about the way affixes combine with words. This is apparently, an amportant characteristic of the Na'vi language. (Now, if I can just get this stuff to sink into my thick head!)

Although some of this has been hard to remember because I was in excruciating pain at the time (my right hip was 'blown out'), there were some very siginificant things presented there, that makes this worth reviewing by everyone.<br /><br />This information is important (and different) enough that, IMHO, it belongs in a new appendix of the dictionary. I would offer to write such a beast (it ultimately needs to be 'translated' into LaTeX), but I think Tìtstewan should have first crack at it because he has done a lot of the groundwork. This appendix should show the various pronoun forms in a compact manner, and show the special rules involved in pronouncing this very important class of words. Additionally, all these words that appear in the dictionary need to be checked for the proper IPA. I suspect we have a mix of 'old' and 'new' forms.

Why not just put the proper IPA in all the current entries, and in The Pronoun Guide (by Tìtstewan), put the Proper stress / IPA, and in Nutshell and Horen, do that as well?<br /><br />I honestly don't think there is anything [desc=ok maybe just a little bit]shocking[/desc] or crazy about these pronouns. It just has one 3-part rule:<br /><br />If it ends in &quot;oe&quot;, then the &quot;oe&quot; is two syllables and the stress on the &quot;o part&quot;.<br />Else if it ends in &quot;ng&quot; and a case/suffix is applied, then the &quot;oe&quot; is one syllable, the &quot;a&quot; from nga comes back, and the stress is on &quot;nga&quot;.<br />Else if it ends in &quot;ng&quot;, then the &quot;oe&quot; is one syllable and the stress is on the &quot;eng part&quot;.

[font=Georgia][size=11pt]A few days ago, I asked about this construct in the [url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/intermediate/prefer-x-to-y/][b]Intermediate Section[/b][/url].<br /><br />I got a response from K.

Here the &quot;more&quot; applies to a verb.<br /><br />Well, a related construction would be,<br /><br />Oe ngato yom nì'ul. 'I eat more than you (do).'<br /><br />So similarly, 'want more' would be:<br /><br />Oel X-ti to Y-ti new nì'ul.<br /><br />But new nì'ul &gt; nulnew.<br /><br />So we have:<br /><br />Oel X-ti to Y-ti nulnew.

What you've determined about [b]nì[/b]- being added to a root that starts with [b]e[/b] is absolutely correct.

So, as you've noted,<br /><br />[i]*nìetrìp[/i] &gt; [b]netrìp[/b]<br /><br />But if the [b]e[/b] is unstressed, then the [b]ì[/b] of [b]nì[/b]- overpowers the [b]e[/b].

<h2 id="204">Si-verbs modification</h2>
<h4>radek.raszka</h4>
Recently there was discussion about possibility and productivity of noun part si-verbs modification. ([url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/index.php?topic=18207.msg598438#msg598438]starts here[/url] and 4 or 5 following posts). Wiki information is quite vague, so why to not ask for more information?<br /><br />[quote=Blue Elf]Recently one of community members who rewrites Na'vi in a nutshell (simple grammar document for beginners) asked me about si-verb, more exactly about productivity of adding affixes to noun part od si-verbs.<br />We have examples like fìkem si/tsakem si/kempe si/wina uvan si, however except these examples there is no writen rule saying that this is productive process. The only information, which is quite vague can be found in our wiki:<br />[url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/Canon/2010/UltxaAyharyu%C3%A4#Refinements_of_si-construction_verbs]http://wiki.learnnavi.org/Canon/2010/UltxaAyharyu%C3%A4#Refinements_of_si-construction_verbs[/url]<br />&quot;Second, like with kem, and apologies that you have to rely on my faulty memory for this one as I asked this during a break so as far as I know I'm the only witness (Hopefully I'm not misremembering), you can use modifiers on si verbs where it makes sense&quot;<br />So, simple yes/no question just to be sure - it is safe to use affixes/adjective modifiers with noun part of si-verbs, if such modification gives sense?[/quote]<br />And what our authority says:<br />[quote=Paul]Ah, that's a good question. The general answer is: [color=blue]You can modify the noun component of si-construction verbs in most cases when it makes sense[/color]. For example, you could modify [b]srung [/b]in [b]srung si[/b]:<br /><br />Txana srung soli po oer.<br />'He helped me a lot.'<br />(Literally, He did much help to me.)<br /><br />But you wouldn't modify [b]nari [/b]in [b]nari si[/b] or [b]kelku [/b]in [b]kelku si[/b]; those are more idiomatic and &quot;frozen,&quot; where modifying the noun component wouldn't be plausible.<br /><br />So like many things in language, there isn't a simple yes-no answer. It's more like a scale: On one end are the si-constructions where the noun part is freely modifiable; on the other end are the &quot;frozen&quot; constructions where the nouns aren't modifiable. The more the &quot;si&quot; part can be interpreted as &quot;doing&quot; something to or with the noun part, the more modifiable the noun part is. So with [b]kem si[/b] and [b]srung si[/b], I'm doing an action and doing help respectively. With [b]nari si[/b] and [b]kelku si[/b], however, I'm not really &quot;doing&quot; eye or &quot;doing&quot; home.<br /><br />I know that's still a bit vague, but I hope it helps.[/quote]<br />And that's all.

Interesting question: is it possible to add attributes to noun in si-versb between this noun and [b]si[/b]? For example: [b]srung atxan si[/b]. Also is it possible to add attributive clauses after [b]si[/b]? For example:<br /><br /> &nbsp;[b]Pelun nga [color=blue]tsakem[/color] ke soli [color=blue]a oe ätxäle soli[/color]?[/b]<br /> &nbsp;[i]Why you did not make what I ask you for?[/i]<br /><br />I guess [b]pelun nga [color=blue]ätxäle soli oe a tsakem[/color] ke soli?[/b] would work, but what about first example?

<h2 id="205">tiny clarification on nguway</h2>
<h4>Saralyn te Späyu</h4>
:D&nbsp; I heard from Karyu Pawl, he said he'd put this in the next Na'viteri post, but for those of you who are curious now:&nbsp; :D<br /><br />[quote]<br />So . . . nguway.<br /><br />Good question. I now realize we have a noun meaning the viper wolf's cry or howl but not yet a verb meaning to howl! So let's see . . .<br /><br />The idea behind nguway is that it's related to way 'song.' It's a &quot;ngu&quot; song. :-) Ngu is supposed to be onomatopoeic, mimicking the sound of a howl. So to carry the idea further, the nantang is singing a song when he's howling, which indicates that rol should be involved.<br /><br />So I'm thinking that the verb 'howl' should be rol nguway, where nguway is acting adverbially: to sing in a nguway, or howling, way. I don't think it should be a transitive structure like *Nantangìl rol nguwayti but rather the intransitive Nantang rol nguway. Along those lines, nguway si would also be possible, and perhaps more expected, but I do like using rol here.<br /><br />So then a &quot;howler&quot; would be a nguwayrolyu. <br /><br />A further thought:<br /><br />Saying rol nguway over to myself, it's pretty clear that the l of rol is unstable here and would drop over time. That would give ro nguway, which would coalesce into one word, the verb ronguway!<br /><br />So howl is then:<br /><br />[b]ronguway[/b] (vin., ro.NGU.way--infixes 1,1) 'howl'<br /><br />In that case, 'howler' would be <br /><br />[b]ronguwayyu[/b] (n., ro.NGU.way.yu) 'howler' <br /><br />I think I like that better![/quote]

<h4>`Eylan Ayfalulukanä</h4>
And that is really appropriate for this canine-like animal. If falulukan roar in the same manner as 'Rrtan lions, that would be a 'song' as well (but we don't know if they do this, and they probably don't, as they do not appear to be social animals like aynantang). I am working on some animal sound proposals I finally hope to get posted this evening.

<h2 id="206">Concerning time words and fìmeu</h2>
<h4>Plumps83</h4>
[font=Georgia][size=11pt]I e-mailed K. Pawl a few days ago about a question I had for quite a while. <br /><br />With time words I was always confused what adposition to use (if at all) because we have different examples where there is sometimes a [b]mì[/b], sometimes nothing at all. Also, different languages use different prepositions (or none at all?) to deal with talking about time.<br /><br />It may not be that surprising but for those of you who are interested, here is his response:[/size][/font]<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl, Aug 6][font=book antiqua][size=12pt]About your time-word question:<br /><br />I've been loose about whether or not [b]mì[/b] should, or needs, to be included with such words. The choice is usually optional, just as in English we can say &quot;On Mondays I go swimming&quot; or simply &quot;Mondays I go swimming.&quot; (Is there anything comparable in German?) In this latter example, &quot;Mondays&quot; is acting as an adverbial. That's how i would analyze &quot;[b]rewon[/b]&quot; and &quot;[b]kaym[/b]&quot; in the corresponding Na'vi sentences. ([b]Kaym oe slele nìtrrtrr.[/b]) <br /><br />The one thing we CAN'T say is *mì kamtrr (or, of course, *kxamtrrmì). That's because &quot;noon&quot; is a point in time, not a range, and you can't be &quot;in&quot; a point. Words like [b]rewon[/b] and [b]kaym[/b] are obviously ranges, so you can indeed be &quot;in&quot; them. <br /><br />For [b]zusawkrr[/b] and [b]ftawnemkrr[/b], I would definitely include [b]mì[/b]. I don't (yet?) have a good rule or guideline for that, but it feels right.[/size][/font][/quote]<br /><br />[font=Georgia][size=11pt]Another titbit… for those of you who wonder about the stacking of demonstrative/plural prefixes.<br />In another e-mail, he wrote:<br /><br />[quote=K.Pawl, Aug 6][font=book antiqua][size=12pt]Ngaru fìmeu, ma tsmuk. :-)<br /><br />[…]<br /><br />P.S.

[b]Eltur tìtxen si nìteng![/b] I just looked up [b]fì'u[/b] and [b]tsa'u[/b] in the dictionary. [b]Eì'u[/b] is listed as a pronoun, and [b]tsa'u[/b] as a demonstrative. Perhaps we need to fix the part of speech on [b]tsa'u[/b] to be consistent with what K. Pawl is telling us. I also wonder if a special note on plural usage is needed here, or if that just follows with usage on other pronouns?<br /><br />I also wonder, if we have [b]fìmeu[/b], if [b]fìpxeu[/b] is possible as well?

I think it really may be this:<br /><br />[quote author=Tanri link=topic=25533.msg612270#msg612270 date=1407502552]<br />Yes, it is confusing a little.<br />As I know, [u]pronoun[/u] this/that (fì’u/tsa’u) is looked at as a single noun without cutting it in a prefix and root. Therefore number mark comes in front of it (mefì’u).<br />However, a [u]noun[/u] follows common pattern [i]fì/tsa - number - noun[/i].<br /><br />What do you think about this example:<br />[i]Fìmenikroi lu lor nìtxan, rutxe piveng oer teyngta mefì’u lu pesur?[/i]<br />[desc=based on the noun nikroi]These two hair ornaments[/desc] are very beautiful, tell me please whose [desc=based on the pronoun fì’u]these[/desc] are?<br />[/quote]<br /><br />noun 'u has form fì-me+u<br />pronoun fì'u has form ay+fì'u<br /><br />This is all really strange. This also may be just because Pawl forgot about the single exception about 'u he made. And the exception made long ago kind of makes sense:<br /><br />Plural of 'u = ayu<br />plural of fì'u = ayfì'u<br /><br />Because fì'u is already some special pronoun. <br /><br /><br />??? :-\\<br />

<h2 id="207">Reflexive / Causative in combination with the infixes &lt;us&gt; and &lt;awn&gt;</h2>
<h4>Titstewan</h4>
[b]Kaltxì ma frapo[/b],<br /><br />There was recently a discussion if one can combine reflexive &lt;[b]äp[/b]&gt; and causative &lt;[b]eyk[/b]&gt; with the active/passive participles.<br />As this is a quite difficult question, Pawl could only answer a part of it:<br />[quote=Ta Pawl]<br />[...]<br />You ask some excellent questions! Most of them I want to think about for a bit longer, since the ramifications are important.<br /><br />One preliminary judgment, though: [u]&lt;[b]awn[/b]&gt; can&#039;t be used with &lt;[b]äp[/b]&gt;:[/u]<br /><br />*Oel tse&#039;a ioangit ayäpawnur. --That&#039;s not grammatical.<br /><br />The reason is that &lt;[b]awn[/b]&gt; is only used with transitive verbs, since it&#039;s only for transitive verbs that passive makes sense: We can have tsawne&#039;a, yawnur, tspawnang, etc. but not *zawna&#039;u, *hawnahaw, *kxawnem, etc. <br /><br />But what &lt;[b]äp[/b]&gt; does is turn a transitive verb into an intransitive one. We say, for example, Pol ngati tse&#039;a. &#039;He sees you.&#039;<br /><br />But with the reflexive, it&#039;s Po tsäpe&#039;a &#039;He sees himself,&#039;&nbsp; not *Pol tsäpe&#039;a. This indicates that tsäpe&#039;a is intransitive. it would be like having an intransitive verb &quot;self-see,&quot; (which of course we do not have in English!) that cannot take an object: If such a verb existed, &quot;John self-sees&quot; would be OK, but &quot;John self-sees Mary&quot; would not be possible. <br /><br />So this eliminates one cell in the matrix:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &lt;[b]äp[/b]&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &lt;[b]eyk[/b]&gt;<br /><br />&lt;[b]us[/b]&gt;<br /><br /><br />&lt;[b]awn[/b]&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [color=maroon]NO[/color]<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll be thinking more about the other 3 cells. ;-)<br /><br />I&#039;ll get back to you again as soon as I can.[/quote]<br /><br />So, a quarter of the question has been answered: [color=red]combination of &lt;[b]awn[/b]&gt; and &lt;[b]äp[/b]&gt; is impossible[/color]<br /><br />[b]Update[/b]:<br />[url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/index.php?topic=27379.0]Reflexive / Causative in combination with the infixes &lt;us&gt; and &lt;awn&gt; - The 2nd[/url] :) :)

Ever seen the Dutch spelling rules for making compound nouns? :D<br /><br />[spoiler=Short summary of the rule]Use [b]-en-[/b] when the first part of the compound has a plural on [b]-en[/b], else use [b]-e-[/b]. Except when it also has a plural on something else (yes, there are words with two possible plurals...). And, except if there is only one of the item. And, except if there are possibly more of the item, but it is logically presumed that you only mean one of them (this is actually quite arbitrary). (There are some more exceptions like these.) Now on these exceptions there are several exceptions, for example &quot;old&quot; compounds that the spelling is fixed of, and stupid things like &quot;if the first part is an animal and the compound is a plant, don't use [b]-en-[/b], even if the other rules would imply that&quot;. Oh wait, and there have been two spelling reforms already since I first learned the rule, which both changed the rules for this to &quot;make it easier&quot;, so I'm not sure what exceptions are added and removed in the meantime...

Now the most stupid part: there is no difference in pronunciation between the two forms (except if you speak really carefully).

That just says what syllables are allowed to be made up of. You'd think that the rules of constructing a monosyllabic word would be exactly equal to the rules of constructing a syllable... but then why in the world can't u exist? it must always be 'u or ayu. And beyond that rule and the actual existence of a as a &quot;word&quot;, we have (afaik) zero words ever consisting of only a vowel or only a diphthong.

Here the English translation would be, &quot;He threw a/the stone to me.&quot;<br />2/[b]Oel tsre'i tskxet ngaru[/b].<br />The dative case would be used in the sense of giving the stone to someone, although there's some overlap here with ne. Here again the English would be, &quot;&quot;He threw a/the stone to me.&quot;<br />English version of both examples is the same, what is a little confusing, as meaning is not completely the same. It can be well seen in translation into my native Czech:<br />1/ [color=red]Oel [/color][color=blue]tsre'i[/color] tskxet [color=green][u][b]ne[/b][/u] nga[/color] -&gt; ([color=red]já[/color]) [color=blue]Hážu [/color]kámen [color=green][u][b]k[/b][/u] tobě[/color].

This sentence has a neutral meaning. One throws a stone in direction to X, but the attention behind is not aggresive. No matter if you will catch the stone or not.<br />Here a example of the intended meaning:<br />[desc=neytiri said, O Jake, you should throw your spear to this trunk.

<h4>radek.raszka</h4>
As confirmation doesn't hurt, here it is:<br />[quote=Blue Elf]I’d like to ask some explanation about “throw at” conversation you have had recently with Tìtstewan.<br />Here are two sentences with your explanation:<br />1/ [b]Oel tsre'i tskxet ne nga[/b].<br />Ne does indeed imply the physical act of throwing towards someone, keeping with the idea that verbs of motion use ne as the place towards which the motion is directed. Here the English translation would be, &quot;He threw a/the stone to me.&quot;<br />2/[b]Oel tsre'i tskxet ngaru[/b].<br />The dative case would be used in the sense of giving the stone to someone, although there's some overlap here with ne. Here again the English would be, &quot;&quot;He threw a/the stone to me.&quot;<br />English version of both examples is the same, what is a little confusing, as meaning is not completely the same. It can be well seen in translation into my native Czech:<br />1/ [color=red]Oel [/color][color=blue]tsre'i[/color] tskxet [color=green][u][b]ne[/b][/u] nga[/color] -&gt; ([color=red]já[/color]) [color=blue]Hážu [/color]kámen [color=green][u][b]k[/b][/u] tobě[/color].

<h2>Re: to &quot;throw at&quot; X</h2>
<h4>Titstewan</h4>
Thanks for posting it! :D<br />I got that mail too. ;D<br /><br />Yeah, the general problem is, the English language solves the dative case in two ways: [i]by word order[/i] or by using the [i]preposition [b]to[/b][/i]. That “to-dative” could overlap with the version that mean [b]to[/b] as direction, of course. This is what cause confusion.<br /><br />I addad tha to the OP too. :)

<h2 id="211">Distributive Property of Adjectives</h2>
<h4>Ean Tirea</h4>
Kaltxì ma frapo! I have a little confirmation here. It may have been obvious to some, but I wanted to be totally sure of this. <br /><br />The other day, Neytiri and I were discussing what the following phrase means:<br /><br />[b]eana kelku sì taw[/b]<br /><br />And so, we resolved to send him an email. Here is the email I sent to Pawl:<br /><br />[quote=Tirea Aean][size=10pt]<br />Kaltxì ma Pawl!<br /><br />Oel ngati kameie.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So here is the quick question, about how a certain phrase in Na'vi works...<br /><br />A.) eana kelku sì taw<br /><br />Is this ambiguous or not? How should it be parsed?<br /><br />1.) {eana kelku} sì taw<br /><br />OR<br /><br />2.) eana {kelku sì taw}<br />= eana kelku sì eana taw<br /><br />Although we do know that to break any ambiguity, we can say:<br /><br />B.) kelku aean sì taw<br /><br />and it can only parse as<br /><br />{kelku aean} sì taw<br /><br />I suppose a question is, Does the adjective ean in (A) distribute across both nouns connected by sì? (Like in English, and like (2)) or is it already unambigous and (1) is the only correct interpretation?<br /><br />This has really been making Neytiri and I think a lot today.<br /><br />Eywa ngahu,<br />Ta Kori<br />[/size][/quote]<br /><br />And out of the blue today, he decided to call my mobile with the reply to this email. I will try my best to recall verbatim quotes from memory. (I really wish I had a means at the time to record the conversation!)<br /><br /><br />[quote=Tirea Aean]<br />So did you get my email about whether or not adjectives can distribute to both things?<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I just assumed that the attributive adjective applies exclusively only to the noun it is placed next to and the a points to.[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Paul Frommer]<br />Ah yes. I did, actually. [...] I've actually used a similar example before when teaching about this same ambiguity in English. The example was something like:<br /><br />Older men and women...<br /><br />As you know, this phrase is ambiguous in English. It's natural in cases like these to distribute the adjective to both nouns.<br /><br />[...] So you assumed that the adjective [i]doesn't[/i] distribute?[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Tirea Aean]<br />Yes. That seemed to make intuitive sense to me. But then I thought about it --[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Paul Frommer]<br />Hmm.. If the adjective [i]didn't[/i] distribute... then there would be no real way of having it apply to both nouns without .. without repeating the same adjective again.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Tirea Aean]<br />Right, yes. And I could see that being cumbersome.[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Paul Frommer]<br />You're right; it [i]would be cumbersome[/i]. I think it's natural to be able to distribute it across without repeating it again. But yes, that certain word order of the phrase would be ambiguous. What do you think of this?<br /><br />kelku sì taw aean[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Tirea Aean]<br />I'd say house and blue sky; where taw is ean but not necessarily kelku. Again I didn't assume distribution across, even if the adjective is at the end. But I can see how this would work.<br />Okay, so this very same ambiguity of whether or not the adjective is supposed to distribute exists in Na'vi. I see. But yet we survive.[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Paul Frommer]<br />Yes, exactly, we survive. And as you said, we can disambiguate by moving the word ean in this case.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Tirea Aean]<br />Ah, that makes sense. So now we know this basically works more or less exactly like in English.<br />[...]<br />[/quote]<br /><br />And that's pretty much it about that.<br /><br />I also asked him quickly as an aside about the existence (or non-existence) of the word: le'ul. <br /><br />[quote=Tirea Aean]<br />By the way, does le'ul exist? the adjective version of nì'ul? We seem to have run across the same kind of problem we had with nì'aw before. And then le'aw came out to solve it.<br />You can literally put the word only in any slot at all in an English sentence and it drastically changes the meaning in a different way every time.<br />It would be useful to have le'ul to say stuff like &quot;More people do X than do Y&quot; as opposed to &quot;People do more X than they do Y&quot;[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Paul Frommer]<br />Ahh. Hmm That's an interesting question.. Let me think about that for a little while and I'll get back to you on that.<br />[/quote]<br /><br /><br /><br />Well, there you go. Another confirmation, and possibly one more to come. :)

I imagine much of this ambiguity can be cleared up by context.<br /><br />For example if I own a blue house and say &quot;blue house and sky&quot;, then you know I mean both are blue because the sky is a known color. I think similar ambiguity in Na'vi could likely be resolved in a similar way. If further clarity was required then double adjectives could easily be used.

Hmm, I never even thought of this as an ambiguity since I'd always (incorrectly, as I know now) link the adjective to the noun directly 'touching' the -a-.<br />Good to know that I was wrong, learning more every day!

<h4>Plumps83</h4>
[font=georgia][size=11pt]I was curious about two examples that can be found on the movie line page and this little ‘[url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/language-updates/pseudo-canon-from-bd-live-content/]pseudo canon[/url]’ example, but never made it to the dictionary, i.e. [b]sänume si[/b] and [b]zoplo si[/b]. I asked Paul about it and he responded.<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl, 15 Dec 2015][font=book antiqua][size=11pt]As for the canonical examples for [b]sänume si[/b] and [b]zoplo si[/b], the one for [b]sänume si[/b] is totally accurate. The example for [b]zoplo si[/b] needs a slight adjustment. It's just:<br /><br />. . .[b] fte po kelkur zoplo sivi sìk.[/b]<br /><br />I didn't have the [b]fì[/b]- on [b]kelkur[/b], and there's no [b]ke[/b] before the verb. The original English that I had to translate into Na'vi was: &quot;I have said no dreamwalker will come here to offend our home!&quot; Your Na'vi makes sense, of course, but from a slightly different angle: &quot;No dreamwalker will come here, so as not to offend our home!&quot; Although now I guess that should be [b]fteke[/b], right?[/quote]<br /><br />[font=georgia][size=11pt]The line for [b]sänume si[/b] I gave was:<br /><br />[b]Ma ’ite, awngeyä fya’ori zene nga sänume sivi poru fte tsivun pivlltxe sì tivìran nìayoeng.[/b]<br />My daughter, you will teach him our way to speak and walk as we do.<br /><br />from the [url=http://wiki.learnnavi.org/index.php?title=Na%27vi_from_Avatar_Movie#Scene_in_Hometree]movie line page[/url]<br /><br />So the line from the pseudo-canon bit should be:<br /><br />[b]Poltxe oe san zene kea uniltìranyu ke ziva’u fìtseng fte po kelkur zoplo sivi sìk.[/b]<br />I have said no dreamwalker will come here to offend our home!<br /><br /> :D That’s it.

<h2 id="213">New vocabulary from Toruk - The First Flight</h2>
<h4>NaVi_Quebec</h4>
The local newspaper made a report about the Toruk show.&nbsp; Somehow they were granted access to the scripts, so they could translate the Na'vi for us. I found a new verb, [i][b]pllhrr[/b][/i], to warn or alert.<br /><br />Should we wait for the confirmation of Pawl?<br /><br />Sorry for the bad pic:<br />[img width=400]http://forum.learnnavi.org/gallery/8/11067-150116182911.jpeg[/img]<br /><br />(Edit: Corrected, picture posted)

Transitive verbs can always also be used intransitively.<br />[/quote]<br />I would say intransitive for pllhrr.<br /><br />Even if I agree with you, it doesn't always work like this. Think about [b]nume[/b], which is intransitive when it could've been transitive. Also, normally, the people you warn are the direct objects. In the sample, the clans are indirect objects. I would compare it with [b]pamtseo si[/b], which is (forced to be) intransitive when in English, the thing you write is the direct object.<br /><br />But it's only time for guesses. We should get a confirmation by the end of the North American tour.

IMHO it would be fair to add note, that text of[b] Lu 'Aw Na'vi[/b] comes from the YT video. However this text differs from that one I hear in soundtrack. I wonder if there are two versions or final version was simplified....

If I am not mistaken, [b]Lu 'aw Na'vi[/b] aka [b]Awnga lu 'aw[/b] means the same song.

Good - new word after long time!<br /><br />For adding this word to English part of dict-navi try to ask Plumps - I think he can do that. When it is done, word becomes available to other translators.<br /><br />Related to [b]-kuk[/b], my idea is it comes from [b]takuk [/b](strike), so it sounds like war strike / strike of war. I don&#039;t think -kuk is related to drums, so far we have two king of drums: au and wokau. Both based on [b]au[/b], so either this new one comes from pre-au time&nbsp; ;D or my explanation works. Or something else ???

Okay, this may not be a real language update but I don&#039;t know where to post it otherwise... but David Petersen, Christine Schreyer, David Peterson and Karyu Pawl are hosting an AMA (&quot;ask me anything&quot;) session on reddit [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4xehwa/mathnuqtxìtan_we_are_marc_okrand_creator_of/]here[/url].

<h2 id="217">Expressions of &quot;like we&quot;</h2>
<h4>radek.raszka</h4>
Some longer time ago I&#039;ve found interesting problem - what is difference between [b]nìayoeng[/b] and [b]pxel/na ayoeng[/b]. Finally, a few days back, I asked the right person and today response came. So here&#039;s some piece of knowledge:<br />[quote=Blue Elf]<br />I’d like to consult&nbsp; quite simple question, which has two answers: how to say in Na’vi expressions “like/as you”, “like/as we” and similar?<br />First answer is well known – we have adpositions [b]pxel / na[/b], so we can use sentence like:<br />[i]Oe tul nìftxan nìwin [b]na (pxel) nga[/b][/i] -&gt; I run as fast [b]as you[/b].<br /><br />In movie, we can see this example of another option:<br />[i]Ma ’ite, awngeyä fya’ori zene nga sänume sivi poru fte tsivun pivlltxe sì tivìran [color=red][b]nìayoeng [/b][/color][/i]-&gt;&nbsp; My daughter, you will teach him our way to speak and walk [color=red][b]as we[/b][/color] do.<br /><br />Is it possible to use [color=red][b]pxel ayoeng[/b][/color] here? Is there any difference between [b]nìayoeng [/b]and [b]pxel (na) ayoeng[/b] and if yes, what is preferred form and why? And are we free to create our own derivations with nì- ? Some time ago I have read this example of Plumps:<br />[i]Zun oe lirvu nga, zel tsakem ateng sivi [color=green][b]nìnga [/b][/color][/i]-&gt; If I would you, I would do something similar[color=green][b] like you[/b][/color].<br /><br />This usage surprised me for a moment, until I remembered example from movie. So – what‘s your opinion about this question?<br />[/quote]<br />And what Paul answered?<br />[quote]<br />You ask an interesting question. First of all, concerning forms like [b]nìayoeng [/b](pronounced as if it were nay.WENG): yes these are productive with all pronouns: [b]nìoe [/b][nì.O.e], [b]nìnga[/b], etc. <br /><br />[b]Na/pxel [/b]and the [b]nì-[/b] forms, with these pronouns, are [color=blue]sometimes [/color]interchangeable. In sentences that use [b]nìftxan[/b], however, the only the [b]na/pxel[/b] form is used:<br />[i]Oe tul nìftxan nìwin na/pxel nga.[/i]<br /><br />But not:<br />[i]*Oe tul nìftxan nìwin nìnga.[/i]<br /><br />In cases that don&#039;t involve [b]nìftxan[/b], you sometimes have a choice between [b]na/pxel[/b] and the [b]nì-[/b] forms. The difference is that [b]na/pxel[/b] is used more for [color=green][b]how someone or something is perceived[/b][/color]--for example, how someone looks. Example:<br />[i]Key peyä na pum ngeyä lu.[/i] -&gt; His face is like yours.<br /><br />The [b]nì-[/b] forms, on the other hand, are better used [color=green][b]for actions[/b][/color]. The translation of [b]nìayoeng[/b], for example, is usually best as &quot;as we do.&quot; If there were an English word &quot;us-ly,&quot; that would be a good translation too. :-)<br />[i]Plltxe po nìayoeng.[/i] -&gt; She speaks like us. -OR- She speaks as we do.<br /><br />Hope that clarifies thing a bit!<br />[/quote]<br />So - now it&#039;s clear. Learn and use.&nbsp; :)

(IMHO f-words should considered subordinators only).<br />[b]Tuteo[/b] is not pronoun, it&#039;s (indefinite) noun, so Paul&#039;s answers does not apply here.<br />And related [b]nìpum[/b] - pum is something special, it&#039;s &quot;repeater&quot; of previously mentioned noun/pronoun, so it can work in some contexts, but not in others. I&#039;d would avoid it&#039;s usage.<br />Personally I would use nì- + pronoun only for personal pronouns, nothing else.<br />But I can try to ask more about this theme.

<h2 id="218">Reflexive / Causative in combination with the infixes &lt;us&gt; and &lt;awn&gt; - The 2nd</h2>
<h4>Titstewan</h4>
So, few days back, I have reminded Pawl about an old question regarding possibility of combination of &lt;[b]äp[/b]&gt;/&lt;[b]eyk[/b]&gt; +&lt; [b]us[/b]&gt;/&lt;[b]awn[/b]&gt;<br /><br />Ayngar fì&#039;u:<br /> :)<br />[hr][hr]<br />[...]<br />So, let&#039;s see:<br /><br />[url=http://forum.learnnavi.org/index.php?topic=25569.0]As you know, [b]äp[/b] + [b]awn[/b] is impossible[/url]. There are then 4 possible combinations to consider:<br /> <br />[b]äp + eyk<br />äp + us<br />eyk + awn<br />eyk + us[/b]. <br /><br />All 4 of these ARE possible, at least with certain verbs in certain situations. Here are some examples:<br /><br />[b]äp + eyk[/b]<br /><br />There was an example in one of my blog posts, from April 30, 2015. It concerned the verb &#039;rrko &#039;roll.&#039;<br /><br />http://naviteri.org/2015/04/some-new-words-for-may-day/ <br /><br />And if you yourself are rolling—i.e., causing yourself to roll—use &lt;eyk&gt; along with the reflexive infix &lt;äp&gt;:<br /><br />[b]Tseyk ’äpeykamrrko äo utral a zolup fte hivifwo ftu aysre’ palulukanä. [/b]<br />‘Jake rolled under the fallen tree to escape from the thanator’s teeth.’<br /><br />That is, Jake caused (&lt;[b]eyk[/b]&gt;) himself (&lt;[b]äp[/b]&gt;) to roll . . .<br /><br />[b]äp + us[/b]<br /><br />You yourself gave a good examples of this combination in your first email a couple of years ago. You considered it ungrammatical in Na&#039;vi, but actually, I think it&#039;s OK:<br /><br />[b]Oel tse&#039;a ioangit ayäpusur.[/b]<br />&#039;I see a self-washing animal.&#039;<br />[size=8pt][i]German: Ich sehe ein sich selbstwaschendes Tier.[/i][/size]<br /><br />The English translation, though, might be a little different: &#039;I see an animal (that is in the process of) washing itself.&#039; That&#039;s a bit different from &#039;I see a self-washing animal.&#039; The former sentence implies you&#039;re watching an animal that is in the process of washing itself; the latter typically means you&#039;re watching an animal that has the general characteristic of being able to wash itself, even though it may not be doing that at the present moment. Right now I think that both interpretations are OK in Na&#039;vi, but I need to think about that some more. If you or anyone else has thoughts about this, I&#039;d like to hear them!<br /><br />My German isn&#039;t good enough to know whether or not the German version you&#039;ve provided can have that meaning as well. <br /><br />You also gave another example:<br /><br />[b]Lu oeru piak-säpusia sähena.[/b]<br />I have a self-opening container.<br />[size=8pt][i]German: Ich habe einen (sich) selbstöffnenden Behälter.[/i][/size]<br /><br />This could also mean: &#039;I have a container (that is in the process of) opening itself.&#039; Of course that meaning is a bit bizarre.<br /><br />[b]eyk + awn[/b]<br /><br />A good example of this involves the verb [b]zup[/b] &#039;[i]fall[/i].&#039; As you know, the causative version of this, [b]zeykup[/b], means &#039;[i]drop (deliberately)[/i].&#039; So [b]zeykawnup[/b] is the participle meaning &#039;dropped&#039;: [b]rum azeykawnup[/b], &#039;[i]a (deliberately) dropped ball.[/i]&#039;<br /><br />[b]eyk + us[/b]<br /><br />As you pointed out, [url=http://naviteri.org/2010/07/vocabulary-update/comment-page-1/#comment-95]I had mentioned in a comment[/url] that [b]zeykuso[/b] is a correct word. An example of its use might be: [b]&#039;ewll azeykuso[/b] &#039;[i]a healing plant[/i]&#039;--that is, a plant with healing properties.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />ta Pawl<br /><br />[hr][hr]<br /><br />I&#039;ve replied back also to clarify the question if [i]tì+us[/i] with &lt;äp&gt;/&lt;eyk&gt; would be possible too.<br /> :palulukan:

Well, you can say &quot;every eye can see&quot;, but it can be used like:<br /><br />Nari atsuse&#039;a tse&#039;a nì&#039;ul -&gt; Seeing eye see more (if you know how to see, you can see more; normal eye see just common things).<br />Just my ideas.

<h2 id="219">about fmetok and po/fo</h2>
<h4>Plumps83</h4>
[size=11pt][font=georgia]Ma frapo,<br /><br />Just a small confirmation. I was courious to know how [b]tìfmetok/fmetok[/b] is used. So I asked K. Pawl about it and here is his response:<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl, 22 Feb 2017][size=11pt][font=book antiqua]Yes, [b]tìfmetok[/b] can be a test in school. It can also be a more abstract test, as in &quot;test of strength&quot; or &quot;a test of our resolve.&quot; And [b]fmetok[/b] is vtr, &#039;test somebody.&#039; The infixes are indeed 1, 2. ([b]Fmetok[/b] has nothing to do with [b]tok[/b].) Here&#039;s a line from the original Avatar script, for the scene where Neytiri has brought Jake to Hometree for the first time, and Mo&#039;at has just examined him:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [b]Neytiril fmayetok fìtsamsiyut.[/b]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;Neytiri will test this &quot;warrior.&quot;&#039; [/font][/size][/quote]<br /><br />[size=11pt][font=georgia]So, [b]fmetok[/b] is [color=maroon]vtr[/color]. and infix 1,2.<br /><br /><br />I was also wondering for a little story I was writing whether it is ok to refer to animals as [b]po/fo[/b]. He said:<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl, 22 Feb 2017][size=11pt][font=book antiqua]Yes, in the same way we can do it in English. It really depends on the kind of animal and our relationship to it. I only call my cats &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she,&quot; but to refer to an insect I&#039;d probably say &quot;it.&quot;[/font][/size][/quote]

<h2 id="220">Little confirmation on takuk</h2>
<h4>Plumps83</h4>
[size=11pt][font=georgia]I had this question in [url=https://forum.learnnavi.org/vocab-phrases/a-question-about-takuk/][b]this thread[/b][/url], namely if [b]takuk[/b] could be used for “strike” in the sense of “hit, beat, slap” because in German the meaning can be different.<br /><br />I decided to ask K. Pawl about it and I got this response:[/font][/size]<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl, 21 March 2017][size=10pt]Good question! I wasn&#039;t aware of the difference in German. I only knew &quot;treffen&quot; in the sense of &quot;meet.&quot; I guess the underlying idea is that if you strike a target, you&#039;re connecting with it, or in effect meeting it. Very understandable.<br /><br />In Na&#039;vi, though, we CAN use [b]takuk[/b] in the broader sense of &quot;beat,&quot; &quot;slap,&quot; or &quot;strike,&quot; as you&#039;ve indicated. The underlying idea is more like the English use of &quot;strike,&quot; where you physically hit something with force. So you could say, for example, &quot;[b]Oeti takuk ra&#039;ä![/b]&quot; (I hope you never have to say that!)[/size][/quote]<br /><br />[size=11pt][font=georgia]There you go, folks :D <br /><br />I guess a small correction in the dictionary is in order ;)

<h2>Re: Etymology of the word &quot;Ketuwong&quot;</h2>
<h4>Titstewan</h4>
Interesting.<br />I guess, [b]ketuwong[/b] could origin from the root [i]*wong[/i] + the negative element [i]ke-[/i]. The [i]-tu-[/i] element is just a personification marker. Maybe, in a very old step of Na&#039;vi, it means something like &quot;familiar, known&quot; [i](*wong)[/i] + not [i](ke-)[/i] + person [i](-tu-)[/i] = [i]not familar/known person[/i] aka alien. Not sure why [i]-tu-[/i] is between [i]ke-[/i] and [i]-wong[/i] but probably, once in Na&#039;vi they could have been used as a prefix.

<h4>Ean Tirea</h4>
Because of how ancient this word is, it was likely thought of before -tu suffix was solidified. I always thought of it the way Tìtstewan just said, though, officially there is no clear etymology which means that both words are just roots and any derivation or etymology is to be considered coincidence. /shrug<br /><br />Sent from my LG-K550 using Tapatalk<br /><br />

<h2>Re: Concerning time words and fìmeu</h2>
<h4>`Eylan Ayfalulukanä</h4>
1I guess my comment was misunderstood.<br /><br />By &#039;single vowel words&#039;, I meant words that consist of a vowel (or dipthong) and one other consonant. There are many examples of these words. [b]&#039;u[/b] is such a word, and is unusual in that it can lose its consonant due to lenition. This may be why we have words like [b]tsaw[/b], which can be used in place of [b]tsa&#039;u[/b]. It may also be a pronunciation thing, and I know K. Pawl likes those little pronunciation things (most of which I can&#039;t remember.)<br /><br />There is nothing in [i]Horen[/i] that prevents a word that is just a single vowel. However, [i]Horen[/i] may not be complete in this regard. We do have one single vowel (no consonant) word, and that is an important one, [b]a[/b]. Something tells me there will not be other words like this.

<h2>Re: Concerning time words and fìmeu</h2>
<h4>Ean Tirea</h4>
&#039;u is the only single syllable word whose short plural form would yield only a single vowel remaining in the word. But there&#039;s this:<br /><br />[quote=Horen]<br />3.1.3.1. The plural prefix only may be dropped if there is lenition. The plural of prrnen is either ayfrrnen or the short plural frrnen (but see §6.5.2.2).[sup]2[/sup]<br /><br />[sup]2[/sup] Exception: ’u thing does not take the short plural, always occuring as ayu.<br /><br />6.5.2.2. Since lenition alone is also used as the short plural (§3.1.3.1), there is a chance for<br />number uncertainty depending on the conversational context. To be clear about number, use<br />the full plural prefix ay+; the lenited form without ay+ should be interpreted as singular. NT<br />(1/7/2010)[/quote]<br /><br />And so it stands that a is the only single letter word in the language, consisting of a lone vowel. I also do not see there being any other ones like this. Even the ayu having no short plural exception listed above appears to be a deliberate attempt to avoid single letter words made of one vowel. (For what It&#039;s worth, It&#039;s also clearly known that a single consinant could never be a syllable or word.)<br /><br />But....<br /><br />Still tho. What&#039;s up with fìmeu and what are the implications? We sparked discussion in thia thread about ayfì&#039;u, aysa&#039;u/sa&#039;u but did we ever get answers on the order of presidence of the plural prefixes and fì-/tsa-? We know so far that the general rule has been fì-/tsa- first then me+/pxe+/ay+ but we were blown away by the actual existence of aysa&#039;u and ayfì&#039;u as exceptions to this rule. Is any theory in this thread on the mark about all this? Someone should send KP an email about this. I&#039;m super curious :)<br /><br />Sent from my LG-K550 using Tapatalk<br /><br />

<h2>Re: Concerning time words and fìmeu</h2>
<h4>`Eylan Ayfalulukanä</h4>
Horen 3.3.7 gives the order of prefixes on a noun, and [b]fìmeu[/b] does not violate that. However, words like [b]*ayfì&#039;u[/b]. Do. Fìmeu has a useful meaning as Pawl points out. However [b]fìayu[/b] does not, unless you rearrange the prefixes in your mind, such that [b]fìayu[/b] means &#039;all these things&#039;.<br /><br />Unquestionably a question for Pawl, as I don&#039;t think this has been formally addressed anywhere.<br /><br />Another thing. The reference in Horen 6.5.2.2, if I am interpreting it right, implies the short plural always means the singular. This makes more sense whatsoever, and maybe I am somehow misreading that. (BTW, the use of the long plural for clarity or emphasis was understood early on, and this is why I deliberately chose &#039;Eylan Ayfalulukanä over &#039;Eylan Falulukanä as my Na&#039;vi name.)

Concerning the long vs short plural, I don&#039;t know if it has been addressed before, but my hunch is that the long plural should ALWAYS be preferred in ceremonial situations eg. alongside ohe, ngenga etc.

Short plural is a shortcut to express plural. All it was saying is if you encounter a noun that has changed due to a lenition-causing adposition like mì+, then the lenited noun is to be taken as lenited singular, not short plural.

In last LEP submission was used construction &quot;txopu sleyku&quot;, known from examples published earlier at Naviteri.<br />Surprisingly, &quot;txopu sleyku&quot; is not listed in dictionary, what confused me and I asked our karyu Paul for explanation. And it came quickly, together with other confirmations I asked for. Here&#039;s our complete conversation:<br /><br />[quote=Question from Blue Elf]<br />Dear Paul,<br />One question just popped in my mind, which has relation with one of proposals, which uses the same construction. It is based on two examples published on Naviteri:<br />[b]Ngeyä aylì’ul akxapnga’ txopu ke sleyku oet kaw’it.[/b] -&gt; Your threatening words don’t scare me one bit.&nbsp; ([url=http://naviteri.org/2015/03/kap-si-ayunil-saylahe-threats-dreams-and-other-things/]source[/url])<br />[b]’Uol ikranit txopu sleykolatsu, taluna po tsìk yawo.[/b] -&gt; Something must have frightened the banshee, because it suddenly took to the air. ([url=http://naviteri.org/2012/01/mipa-zisit-ayliu-amip-new-words-for-the-new-year/]source[/url])<br /><br />Based on these examples, [color=red]txopu sleyku[/color] can be considered as transitive verb with meaning &quot;[color=red]scare/frighten sb[/color]&quot;, although this idea is not marked in any way (you didn’t mention it as verb). So it is safe consider it as separate dictionary entry? Or is it construction, which can allow us to (freely?) create another verbs in form [color=green]&lt;noun&gt;(or possibly &lt;adjective&gt;) sleyku[/color] with rough meaning &quot;[color=green]produce &lt;noun&gt;(&lt;adjective&gt;) to sb.[/color]&quot;? I can think of [color=blue]*paynga‘ sleyku[/color] = &quot;cause someone to get wet&quot; or [color=blue]*tìprrte‘/nitram sleyku[/color] = &quot;cause someone to feel joy/happy&quot;. What do you think about it? Could it be possible?<br />[/quote]<br />[quote=Answer from Paul]<br />Radovan, <br /><br />Here&#039;s what I just wrote to Mark Miller about this:<br />[quote]<br />Well, I&#039;ve gone back and forth on this. :-)&nbsp; I was first going to say that I agree with you--there&#039;s no need to put [b]txopu sleyku[/b] in the dictionary, since [i]sleyku [/i]is already there, basically meaning &quot;cause to become.&quot; (And yes, sleyku-verbs are vtr.). So [b]txopu sleyku[/b] is easily understandable as &quot;cause to become afraid&quot; = &quot;frighten.&quot; In other words, anyone with a grounding in Na&#039;vi seeing [b]txopu sleyku[/b] should be able to grasp its meaning. On the other hand, if someone wants to know the most common way to say &quot;frighten,&quot; it might not be obvious. For that reason I&#039;d say yeah, go ahead and put it in the dictionary, as vtr., right after[i] txopu si[/i].<br />[/quote]<br />As for your other examples with sleyku, I think they&#039;re fine. In other words, [b]sleyku [/b]constructions are quite productive, and in general don&#039;t need to be listed in the dictionary. But as I said above, since &quot;frighten&quot; is so common and useful, I thought it wouldn&#039;t hurt to include it in the dictionary.<br />[/quote]<br />In short:<br />[list]<br />[li][b]txopu sleyku[/b] is officially part of dictionary[/li]<br />[li]we can create new verbs using noun/adjective + sleyku freely[/li]<br />[/list]<br />Enjoy new rule!

<h4>Plumps83</h4>
[font=georgia][size=11pt]Kaltxì ma frapo,<br /><br />maybe this is not news for you but I thought I’d let you know. For the German study group last week I wrote a short story for listening comprehension that contained the sentence (as I wrote it):<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  *[b]Sunu poru syulang sì mauti ulte fwa tswayon yaka.[/b]<br /><br />with the intended meaning “he (i.e. a bird) likes flowers, fruits and to fly through the air.”<br /><br />There was a discussion about how to say “through the air” and — more importantly — whether [b]ulte[/b] was correct here. I had the chance to ask K. Pawl about it and he responded:<br /><br />[quote][font=book antiqua][size=11pt]So let me answer your Na’vi questions:<br /><br />First, I like [b]ka ya[/b] better than [b]mì ya[/b]. Maybe it’s a bias from English, I don’t know, but flying through the air sounds more appropriate than flying in the air. I guess [b]ka ya[/b] is actually “across the air,” but that’s OK too.<br /><br />As for your other question, I would use [b]sì[/b] in that situation, not [b]ulte[/b]. <br /><br />The thing is it’s really a list of parallel items … flowers, fruit, flying through the air. That is, they’re all noun phrases (the first two of which are the simplest possible noun phrases: just a noun). So they should be tied together with [b]sì[/b]. In English, for example, if you say “I like X,” whatever X is is a noun phrase. <br /><br />Or think of it this way: You have three nouns in parallel: [i]syulang, mauti, fì’u[/i]. The last one happens to have a modifying clause attached to it:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  [i]fì’u[/i] [[i]a tswayon ka ya[/i]]&nbsp; = [i]fwa tswayon yaka[/i].<br /><br />Does that make sense?[/quote]<br /><br />[hr]<br /><br />[font=georgia][size=11pt][i]sneyä[/i] vs. [i]peyä[/i]<br /><br />This is about the sentence from the Disney World of Pandora Pamphlet and the sentence<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  [b]Rä’ä fmivi kxu sivi ayioangur fu helkur [u]feyä[/u][/b] <br /><br />where I thought it would be a case for [i]sneyä[/i] because I interprated it as “his/her/their own” regardless of position in a sentence (and I’ve noticed a lot of learners doing this as well).<br /><br />K. Pawl clarified:<br /><br />[quote][font=book antiqua][size=11pt]I think [b]feyä[/b] is better in that sentence than [b]sneyä[/b]. I&#039;d like to reserve [b]sneyä[/b] for cases where a 3rd-person subject (sg. or pl.) interacts with its own possessive, if that makes sense. So this eliminates an ambiguity that can arise in English (and German too?): If I say, &quot;Mark painted his house,&quot; I don&#039;t know if Mark painted someone else&#039;s house (maybe John&#039;s house), or if Mark painted his own house. But this ambiguity doesn&#039;t arise in Na&#039;vi, since in the first case you use [b]peyä[/b] and in the second [b]sneyä[/b]. However, that&#039;s not what&#039;s going on in this sentence, I don&#039;t think, since it&#039;s an imperative sentence (&quot;Don&#039;t harm . . . &quot;) where the (unexpressed) subject is not 3rd person but 2nd (i.e., [b]nga[/b]).

<h2 id="224">location of the vocative</h2>
<h4>wm.annis</h4>
There was some discussion on Discord about the legal positions of the vocative in a larger clause (hard to find canon examples, actually). So I asked Paul about this (Tirea Aean providing some of the examples):<br /><br />[quote]<br />When you have a polar question ending in srak, can it<br />be followed by a vocative, or would the vocative be<br />before the srak?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Ngaru lu fpom srak, ma &lt;name&gt;?&nbsp; (etc.)<br /><br />My guess is that&#039;s just fine, given how vocatives are, but<br />some would appreciate an official declaration.<br /><br />And then there&#039;s:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Ma &lt;name&gt;, nga plltxe nìltsan.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Nga, ma &lt;name&gt;, plltxe nìltsan.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Nga plltxe, ma &lt;name&gt; nìltsan.<br /><br />That is, can a vocative intrude anywhere, as a stylistic<br />thing?[/quote]<br /><br />Paul&#039;s reply<br />[quote=&quot;Karyu Pawl&quot;]<br />Answers are: yes, yes, yes, and yes. All those forms are fine. Vocatives SHOULD follow srak, but 1, 2, and 3 are fine.[/quote]

Good to know this. First part (with srak) is clear and it works the same way as for example in Czech (vocative can go also first in sentence, IMO same as in English, but meaning can be a little different:<br />Are you well, John? - like How are you/How do you do?, general question to ask about John&#039;s state<br />John, are you well? - you look sick, don&#039;t you need any help?? That&#039;s probably why Paul moves vocative behind srak).<br /><br />In second part is missing version with vocative at the end.<br />4. Nga plltxe nìltsan,&nbsp; ma &lt;name&gt;.<br />Here all versions have the same meaning and seems that&#039;s just speaker&#039;s decision, which one to use. However option 3 looks very uncommon (TBH I&#039;d say even incorrect) and hardly used in real life.<br />Also option 2 seems less common than 1+4.

Honestly though, the chances of any of us using that weird word order is probably 1% anyway.<br />#1 and #4 are already by far the most commonly used forms.

<h2 id="225">The Continuous Aspect vs. The Habitual Aspect</h2>
<h4>Skipper587</h4>
We recently had a discussion on this subject on the Learn Na’vi Discord and so I reached out to KP about it and here was his response:<br /><br />[quote]Kaltxì sì fpomtokx ngaru,<br /><br />Krrfpi moeyä, vìsyar oe pivlltxe nì&#039;Ìnglìsì.<br /><br />A discussion on the Learn Na&#039;vi Discord community recently raised some big questions about the Imperfective Aspect, so I figured I&#039;d see if you had the time to share some insight on the issue.<br /><br />The question is how does one distinguish between habitual past action (&quot;used to verb&quot;, habitual aspect) and continuous past action (&quot;was verbing&quot;, continuous aspect) in Na&#039;vi, given that our manner of expressing both is limited to &lt;ì/arm&gt;?<br /><br />Suggested temporary solutions include using pxìm/nìtrrtrr + past imperfective for habitual action, or a yet discovered modal verb indicating the idea of &quot;used to verb&quot;.<br /><br />Ngeyä tì&#039;eyngìri ayoe pereiey. &#039;Ivong Na&#039;vi!<br /><br />Ta Mako[/quote]<br /><br />[quote]Hello again Mako,<br /><br />As I mentioned before, this is an excellent question. It just goes to show how difficult it is to address all the ins and outs of language when you&#039;re creating one from scratch! :-) I hadn&#039;t thought about the habitual vs. continuous past question, which I&#039;m surprised hasn&#039;t come up before. So this is a good time to address it.<br /><br />(By the way, feel free to share this with the community.)<br /><br />My approach was to first take a look at a few of the languages I&#039;m familiar with (to various degrees), and for which I could hopefully find reliable data, handled the distinction. So I checked out French, German, Spanish, Malay/Indonesian, and Persian. To those in the community who speak these languages, please see if you agree with the data I found! And for those who speak other languages, see if your language falls into one of these categories or if it handles the distinction in a different way.<br /><br />My main test sentences were:<br /><br />1. The children were playing in the garden.<br />2. The children used to play in the garden.<br /><br />GERMAN<br />From what I can tell, German treats both of these the same way. <br />Google Translate gives the same translation for both: Die Kinder spielten im Garten. Spielten is the imperfect. (GT is more reliable for the &quot;big&quot; languages--i.e. those with large numbers of speakers--than for smaller-population languages. Still, I&#039;d be interested in whether German speakers agree with this judgment.)<br /><br />PERSIAN<br />Same idea as German. The imperfect is used for both. .بچه ها در باغ بازی می کردند Bacche-haa dar baagh baazi mikardand. (The auxiliary verb mikardand is the imperfect form.)<br /><br />So for some languages, there doesn&#039;t need to be a distinction in the morphology or syntax: Context will decide which interpretation is appropriate.<br /><br />FRENCH<br />At times, apparently, French does the same as German, using the imperfect for both. So &quot;I was working here&quot; and &quot;i used to work here&quot; can simply be Je travaillais ici, where travaillais is the imperfect. <br /><br />However, GT gave different translations for 1 and 2:<br /><br />1:&nbsp;  Les enfants jouaient dans le jardin. (Jouaient is the imperfect.)<br />2:&nbsp;  Les enfants avaient l&#039;habitude de jouer dans le jardin. <br /><br />In 2, we have the expression avoir l&#039;habitude de, &#039;to have the habit of doing something.&#039; (Avaient is the imperfect form.)<br /><br />So French makes the &quot;habitual&quot; idea of &quot;used to&quot; explicit.<br /><br />SPANISH<br />I only know a little Spanish, so this was a big surprise to me. Spanish has a verb soler that means &#039;to be in the custom of, to have the habit of, etc.&#039; So in Spanish we have:<br /><br />1. Los niños jugaban en el jardín. (Jugaban is the imperfect.)<br />2. Los niños solían jugar en el jardín. (Solían is the imperfect of soler.)<br /> <br />So Spanish uses an auxiliary verb, something like Na&#039;vi modals, for the habitual past.<br /><br />MALAY/INDONESIAN<br />M/I doesn&#039;t have tenses. To distinguish 1 from 2, it adds the word biasa for 2, which means &quot;usually&quot; or &quot;customarily&quot;:<br /><br />1. Kanak-kanak bermain di kebun.<br />2. Kanak-kanak biasa bermain di kebun.<br /><br />So there are three different strategies here:<br /><br />(A) No overt difference. Context will decide on the interpretation.<br />(B) A special auxiliary or modal verb to indicate the habitual use.<br />(C) An adverbial expression to indicate the habitual use.<br /><br />What should be the case in Na&#039;vi?<br /><br />I&#039;d like to immediately rule out B, since it would be unusual to unearth a new modal verb at this last date.<br /><br />(A) would work, of course. But since we already have a good adverbial expression for (C), namely nìtrrtrr, one of whose meanings is &#039;regularly,&#039; I don&#039;t see why we can&#039;t use that to distinguish the habitual past from the imperfect:<br /><br />1. Ayeveng uvan sarmi fìtseng. &#039;The children were playing here.&#039;<br />2. Ayeveng uvan sarmi fìtseng nìtrrtrr. &#039;The children used to play here.&#039;<br /><br />I think that works. But if anyone has any comments or questions, please let me know!<br /><br />ta P.[/quote]<br /><br />TL;DR, context and [b]nìtrrtrr[/b] are both acceptable methods for distinguishing between the past habitual aspect and the past continuous aspect, with [b]nìtrrtrr[/b] preferred.

<h4>Plumps83</h4>
[size=11pt][font=georgia]Ma frapo,<br /><br />I had the opportunity to ask K. Pawl about a few things that came up for discussion on the Discord server. So here it goes:[/font][/size]<br /><br />[quote=me][size=10pt]How do we say “Count from 3 to 8”? Would [b]tiam ta pxey vay vol[/b] suffice? Somebody suggested [b]ne[/b] as the adposition.

[b]Ne[/b] implies motion towards something, and is used mainly with verbs of motion like [i]kä, za&#039;u, tätxaw[/i], etc. But this brings up another question. What if it&#039;s not counting from 3 (up)to 8, but rather from 8 down to 3? Countdowns are certainly common! A similar situation occurs if, say, the temperature falls from 20 degrees to 15 degrees. What is &quot;to&quot;? [b]Vay[/b] doesn&#039;t seem appropriate, since it implies &quot;up to.&quot; I&#039;m wondering if we need a new adposition meaning &quot;down to&quot; as the opposite of [b]vay[/b]. […] <br /><br />BTW, I think [b]Tiam vay vol[/b] is fine.[/quote]<br /><br />[size=11pt][font=georgia]So, it seems that there is another adposition needed for “down to”. Maybe something for a new LEP entry? :D Feel free to suggest things there.<br /><br />[hr]<br /><br />[size=11pt][font=georgia]Concerning [i]wä<br />[/i]<br />[quote=me][size=10pt] Could [b]wä[/b] be used as the opposite of [b]ìlä[/b] ‘according to (a person)’ in the sense of ‘contrary to (what somebody said)’ as in:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  [b]Wä Feyral, muntxa ke soli Ralu sì Newey nìwan mesrram.[/b]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  “Contrary to what Peyral reported, Ralu and Newey were not secretly married the day before yesterday.”[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl][size=10pt]I hadn&#039;t thought of that use of [b]wä[/b], but I like it. I don&#039;t see why it shouldn&#039;t be used in the way you&#039;ve described. I also like [b]tì’efuwä oeyä[/b]. It&#039;d be used in sentences like, [b]Tì’efuwä oeyä, fpìl Peyralìl futa ke zene ayoeng kivä.[/b] I.e., &quot;I think we have to go, but Peyral doesn&#039;t.&quot;[/quote]<br /><br />[hr]<br /><br />[size=11pt][font=georgia]And finally, the genitive question:<br /><br />[quote=me][size=10pt]The last one concerns multiple genitives: By now we only ever saw 2 genitives in sequence, e.g. in your example [i]Pìlokä fìhapxìyä tìkan lu law.[/i] ‘The aim of this section of the blog is clear.’ The question arose whether there has to be a special sequence in order for it to make sense?<br /><br />Mako said to this:<br /><br />“I am willing to guarantee you that because the noun ending in -y/ä has to come next to the noun it is possessing […], the nouns have to be sequenced correctly in order for the sentence to make sense. Let me show it like this: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (1) oeyä tsmukä tsko = oeyä } tsmukä { tsko or oeyä { tsmukä { tsko<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (2) tsmukä oeyä tsko = tsmukä } oeyä { tsko or tsmukä { oeyä { tsko<br />Only one of these options means “My sibling’s bow”. The attribution can only go one way once the direction has been decided”<br /><br />Which I’m not so sure about. To me (2) logically also means “my sibling’s bow”. What do you think about that?[/quote]<br /><br />[quote=K. Pawl][size=10pt]I agree with you. Both (1) and (2) seem fine to me, and I don&#039;t see how they could each be interpreted as other than &quot;my sibling&#039;s bow.&quot;<br /><br />However, Mako has pointed to an issue that deserves some scrutiny. Let me throw this out for discussion.<br /><br />Here are the six possible arrangements of the words &#039;itanä, karyuä, and kelku:<br /><br />1. kelku &#039;itanä karyuä<br />2. kelku karyuä &#039;itanä<br />3. &#039;itanä kelku karyuä<br />4. karyuä kelku &#039;itanä<br />5. &#039;itanä karyuä kelku<br />6. karyuä &#039;itanä kelku<br /><br />And here are two possible meanings of these phrases:<br /><br />A. the home of the son&#039;s teacher<br />B. the home of the teacher&#039;s son<br /><br />Here are some questions to consider:<br /><br />a.

Please take my words with a grain of salt, as I am not the most proficient with Na&#039;vi.<br /><br />1. kelku &#039;itanä karyuä A (home of son&#039;s teacher).<br />2. kelku karyuä &#039;itanä B (home of teacher&#039;s son).<br />3. &#039;itanä kelku karyuä A (home of son&#039;s teacher), but possibly incorrect<br />4. karyuä kelku &#039;itanä B (home of teacher&#039;s son), but possibly incorrect.<br />5. &#039;itanä karyuä kelku A (home of son&#039;s teacher).<br />6. karyuä &#039;itanä kelku B (home of teacher&#039;s son).<br /><br />I feel as though the main thing that determines this for me is which one comes first, since there aren&#039;t any other clarifiers. I see 3 and 4 as feeling incorrect, I&#039;m not sure why. It may be an english thing, or it may be that having the subject (home) between the two qualifiers (son and teacher, which dictate which home it is) confuses me even more. At the same time, however, unambiguous sentences don&#039;t feel &#039;wrong&#039; to me even if they&#039;re not in stereotypical &#039;english&#039; order. Still, as a primarily English speaker I tend to personally prefer having it in a linear order, even though Na&#039;vi doesn&#039;t need to follow that pattern, so that may be why I don&#039;t like them as much.<br /><br />The most interesting thing is that to me, despite this being my reflex reaction (re: the meanings), I could [i]easily see both meanings in each sentence[/i]; this is to say that they are all ambiguous to me, because there don&#039;t appear to be any real markers to signify what&#039;s going on. I feel that in the case of a potentially ambiguous sentence / case, the first thing encountered should be treated as the &#039;dominant&#039; meaning; in essence, if you first speak about the teacher, you should assume it&#039;s about the teacher&#039;s son (and in this example, as a result, the teacher&#039;s son&#039;s home). This could easily solve any ambiguity issues that come up.

<h2>Re: 'count to', wä and sequential genitive (discussion)</h2>
<h4>Pamìrik</h4>
[quote=K. Pawl][size=10pt]And here are two possible meanings of these phrases:<br /><br />A. the home of the son&#039;s teacher<br />B. the home of the teacher&#039;s son<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I disagree and believe there is a third possible [mis]understanding: [b]C. the teacher and son&#039;s home[/b]. Though we have seen examples of shared ownership listed with [b]sì[/b], ([b]...mestxelit alu lora merel Tsyanä sì oeyä[/b][sup][url=http://naviteri.org/2014/09/stxeli-alor-the-text/][naviteri][/url][/sup]), I feel the nature of the genitive case lends itself to this possible [mis]understanding. I am not asserting that this is a correct translation or that it should be this way, but I will try to explain why I feel it is easy to interpret it as such.<br /><br />This dives into misgiving I have with the genitive case in Na&#039;vi, where it is one of few grammar structures that can lead to ambiguous constructions because it can&#039;t decide if it is or isn&#039;t an adjective. Most of the time, it does behave very much like an adjective- it can describe things with [b]lu[/b] ([b]fìtseng lu awngeyä[/b]), it goes next to a noun [phrase], but doesn&#039;t have the directional indicator of [b]a[/b] that adjectives have, and doesn&#039;t take up an &quot;adjective slot&quot; ([b]oeyä rima ikran akoak[/b]). Because of this weirdness, you can create ambiguous constructions like [b]tsole&#039;a karyul oeyä numeyut[/b] - [i]my teacher saw student[/i] -OR- [i]teacher saw my student[/i]. There exist workarounds for this, such as [b]tsole&#039;a karyul numeyut oeyä[/b] - obviously &quot;my student&quot; due to placement, so [u]choosing a particular word order for the sentence to escape inherent ambiguity is par for the course for the genitive[/u]. While I think it is ungraceful, it&#039;s not totally unheard of (see [b]apxa[/b], the topical, clause attribution). <br /><br />This brings me to KP&#039;s important questions:<br /><br />[quote]a. Are all six phrases grammatical and acceptable, or are some of them unacceptable?[/quote]<br />This is what we are trying to figure out.<br /><br />[quote]b. Of the acceptable phrases (which may be all of them), which ones have the A meaning and which have the B meaning?[/quote]<br /><br />For each, I will mark how I feel.<br /><br />[b]A. the home of the son&#039;s teacher (son&#039;s teacher&#039;s home)<br />B. the home of the teacher&#039;s son (teacher&#039;s son&#039;s home)<br />C. the home of the teacher and son (misunderstanding), or, &quot;this is a potential problem&quot;[/b] <br /><br />1. kelku &#039;itanä karyuä&nbsp; [b]B[/b]<br />2. kelku karyuä &#039;itanä&nbsp; [b]A[/b]<br />3. &#039;itanä kelku karyuä&nbsp; [b]C[/b]<br />4. karyuä kelku &#039;itanä&nbsp; [b]C[/b]<br />5. &#039;itanä karyuä kelku&nbsp; [b]A[/b]<br />6. karyuä &#039;itanä kelku&nbsp; [b]B[/b]<br /><br />[quote]c. Are any of the acceptable phrases ambiguous--that is, allowing both the A and the B meaning?[/quote]<br />As stated above, 3 and 4 are not immediately clear, and lend themselves to confusion. Because of the genitive case&#039;s ability to be on either side of its noun phrase, AND it&#039;s lack of need to be next to the noun itself (oeyä rima ikran akoak), there are two meanings:<br /><br />3. [b]([/b] [b]([/b]&#039;itanä kelku[b])[/b] karyuä [b])[/b]<br />3. [b]([/b] &#039;itanä [b]([/b] kelku karyuä [b])[/b] [b])[/b]<br /><br />1, 2, 5, and 6 get around this by only providing one valid interpretation:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; [b]([/b] [b]([/b]kelku &#039;itanä [b])[/b] karyuä [b])[/b]<br />5. [b]([/b]&#039;itanä [b]([/b] karyuä kelku [b])[/b] [b])[/b]<br /><br />This is internally consistent with the logic of clause attribution nesting, another grammar problem solved by mandating a specific order/clustering of clauses. Languages don&#039;t always have to be internally logical and consistent, but in nearly everything else Na&#039;vi is, and if it was up to me I would preserve this.<br /><br />[quote]d. If there is ambiguity in any of these cases, how much of a problem is that--or should there be a rule that in a potentially ambiguous case, one meaning is to be preferred over the other?[/quote]<br /><br />There is ambiguity, and it is an issue. I believe that the rule to solve this gracefully is to chain modals to always read in their relationship order from the noun, outward. This is actually how I assumed it worked up until this point, and was surprised to find it wasn&#039;t already a rule. <br /><br />In a world where [b]Ayä noun Byä[/b] constructions are legal, I would always side on the relationship being as follows:<br /><br />3. [b]([/b] [b]([/b]&#039;itanä kelku[b])[/b] karyuä [b])[/b] [B]B. the home of the teacher&#039;s son (teacher&#039;s son&#039;s home)[/b]<br /><br />This mirrors how the topical case can sometimes be employed for inalienable possession (and must be at the beginning of a sentence). I feel the Na&#039;vi would be more used to hearing a &quot;primary possessor&quot; first. Perhaps not the strongest argument, but it&#039;s the only case I could come up with for either of them given the rest of what I know about Na&#039;vi grammar.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing! I eagerly await a decision, one way or another, on this issue.

[b]kelku karyuä &#039;itanä[/b] - the son&#039;s teacher&#039;s home<br />5. [b]&#039;itanä karyuä kelku[/b] - the son&#039;s teacher&#039;s home<br />6.

[b]tsko tsmukä oeyä[/b] - my sibling&#039;s bow<br /><br />Pronouns can&#039;t be possessed by common nouns and make sense, so pronouns appear to be an exception to the rule if this sentence always means &quot;my sibling&#039;s bow&quot; (or mine and my sibling&#039;s bow, as Pam suggests).

<h4>Plumps83</h4>
[font=georgia][size=11pt]Right, long overdue but here are my 2¢<br /><br />Basically, we all seem to be in agreement about the order of 1, 2, 5, and 6. And I derived this from examples of KP and treated it internally as a ‘rule’ same as Pamìrìk did, i.e. the one I gave:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  [b]Pìlokä fìhapxìyä tìkan lu law.[/b]<br /><br />is rendered as “The aim of this section of the blog (is clear.)” (or “the aim of this blog’s section”) and not *“the aim of the blog of this section”. <br /><br />So, I start with the head noun and go outwards from there, whether to the left or to the right doesn’t matter so that I arrive at.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  [b]pìlokä &lt; fìhapxìyä &lt; tìkan[/b]<br /><br />or<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  [b]tìkan &gt; fìhapxìyä &gt; pìlokä[/b]<br /><br />So for me there is a sequential order. And inhernently, we all seem to do that (judging by the same result we all arrive at concerning 1, 2, 5 and 6).<br /><br />I hadn’t thought of Pamìrìk’s solution with the A-ä NOUN B-ä but it is an unusual and maybe foreign concept to wrap our heads around but nonetheless, elegent in my opinion. It doesn’t always[i] have to be[/i] this construct, as KP has shown us other constructs are possible but it would be nice if this opened the possibility. In this instance the genitive would act more like an attributive adjective.<br /><br />If that were to pass then we need a rule on possessive pronoun use as Mako pointed out.<br /><br />So yeah, probably nothing new here, just agreement :D but that also goes to show that a community has tendencies to use the language.[/size][/font]

<h4>Mech</h4>
I am the least experienced in the gang and i didnt have time to assess all the interesting ideas, but I would like to say mine, according to my generic linguistic instict :)<br /><br />I guess that the matter of sequential&nbsp; genitive should have some freedom but in a specific order. To say &quot;the noun&nbsp; of A of B&quot; we can say it as either<br /><br />[b]noun Ayä Byä[/b]<br />OR<br />[b]Byä Ayä noun[/b]<br /><br />The order <br />[b]Ayä noun Byä[/b] (and its reverse)<br />is legal but ambiguous and uncommon, except if there is a predefined context. For example if I ask &quot;was the party held at the home of the teacher&#039;s daughter?&quot; Then you can reply &quot;No, it was held at the home of the teacher&#039;s [b]son[/b]&quot; or &quot;No, it was held at the [b]garage[/b] of teacher&#039;s daughter&quot; using the Ayä noun Byä order, because the order of ownership is already understood.

In the name of the whole current (mainly beginners&#039;) Lerngruppe some of the members composed a message (because it was his birthday), including .mp3 of the text and I sent it to KP (my first mail to him, weeh!). Today he answered, giving us not only very kind words as usual, but also new words:<br /><br />[quote]Ma eylan ayawne alu Eana Unil alu Krrsì sì &#039;eveng te atan alu Andi sì Tomke sì <br /> Thyra sì Malte sì Leo sì Sophie sì Teyvit sì Neyri alu Micha sì Tekre alu <br /> Merve sì Wllìm sì Plumps alu Stefan,<br /><br /> Kaltxì, ma smuk!

<h4>Txawey</h4>
Hi all!<br /><br />As some of you may know, I was recently in Mo&#039;ara for a period on vacation with my family.&nbsp; While there, I downloaded the Play Disney app on a whim and found a game for Mo&#039;ara while waiting in line.&nbsp; Said game had a decently large Pandorapedia, so I figured why not take a look at it!&nbsp; After I was finished, I found several new entries for things we didn&#039;t have before.&nbsp; Since they were all on my phone, I took screenshots (over 200!) and figured why not type them up into a document, so here they are!<br /><br />https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r5qGIhdFNUUamJFs5Bd6_insSiMBt9o8dEqbZr8xTlA/edit?usp=sharing<br /><br />The album with the screenshots is linked within the document itself on the first page as well as here: [url=https://photos.app.goo.gl/coRYv1PwTMXG1jxW8]https://photos.app.goo.gl/coRYv1PwTMXG1jxW8[/url]<br /><br />For the sake of convenience, I will also list the newly-found words here:<br /><br />Flora:<br />[table]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]fyìpmaut[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td] squid fruit tree, [i]octocrus folliculus[/i][/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]koaktutra[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td] goblin thistle, [i]cobalus carduus[/i][/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]lanutral[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td] dandetiger, [i]candea inflata[/i][/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]paysyul[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td] water lily, [i]inrigo lilliam[/i][/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]rumaut[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td] cannonball fruit tree, [i]ecdurus putamen pomus[/i][/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]tsawksyul[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td] sun lily, [i]stella lilliam[/i][/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]tumpasuk[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td] celia fruit tree, [i]pampinus bacca acinum[/i][/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[/table]<br /><br />Fauna:<br />[table]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]fyuatx[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td]anemonoid[/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]lortsyal[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td]shimmyfly[/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]nalutsa[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td]nalutsa[/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]skuka[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td]sagittaria[/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]srakat[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td]dinicthoid[/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]tsiki[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td]reef tick[/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[/table]<br /><br />Name:<br />[table]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]Kapsavan[/b][/td][/tr][/table]the river in the Valley of Mo&#039;ara along which the Shaman of Songs resides, the Na&#039;vi River Journey river[table][tr][td][/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[/table]<br /><br />New Noun:<br />[table]<br />[tr]<br />[td][b]kuru[/b][/td]&nbsp; [td]the organ the Na&#039;vi use to establish a bond (tsaheylu) with Pandoran wildlife[/td]<br />[/tr]<br />[/table]<br /><br />This last one was hinted at in an issue of Tsu&#039;tey&#039;s Path and was confirmed by the author of said comic.&nbsp; To my understanding, it is expected to be clarified further in a future Na&#039;viteri post, but for the sake of completeness, I&#039;ll include it here.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />Txawey

Regarding the difference between the kuru and queue, we honestly don&#039;t know yet&nbsp; :-\\&nbsp; We&#039;re hoping that Karyu Pawl will clarify in his next post.&nbsp; My current guess is that the queue refers to the whole ensemble of braid/sheath as well as the neural whip and kuru refers to the organ itself, i.e. the neural tendrils and such.&nbsp; It is also referred to in the log on the Ilu, but that doesn&#039;t shed too much light on the subject to be honest.<br /><br />In short, we can only guess right now, so we&#039;ll have to wait for Karyu Pawl to shed some light on the subject. :)

I went to negate a verb in a sentence that had a modal verb, instead of negating the modal verb and leaving the other without negation. Curious about whether that was a valid construction I looked but did not find an answer in support or denial of it anywhere in our resources, so an email was sent. This was the response back. :)[/desc]<br /><br />[quote]<br />Kaltxì ma Pawl!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />We have never seen anything from you like “pefya tsun nga ke stivawm aylì’uti oeyä?”, but I wonder, is it possible? <br />Similarly, as a parallel to zenke, does tsunke exist?<br />More generally, in a modal construction, is it possible to negate the second verb, or are we only allowed to negate the modal verb?<br /><br />I ask this because I suspect that there might be a difference between ke tsun yivom and tsun ke yivom:&nbsp; Not able to eat [lack of food, physical inability?] vs. able to not eat [willpowered fasting during a feast?]<br /><br />Irayo nìli, I hope all is well!<br />[...][/quote]<br /><br />[quote=Pawl]<br />[...]<br />When you have a modal and a negative together, the question is, which one has the wider scope? Take “must,” for example. Using the verb “go,” there are two possibilities:<br /> <br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp; NEG&nbsp; [MUST go]&nbsp;  To use clumsy English, this means we’re negating the idea of obligatory going. So MUST falls within the scope of NEG. In other words, you don’t have to go, it’s not necessary to go, it’s not obligatory to go.<br /><br />In Na’vi, of course, that’s ke zene kivä.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp; MUST&nbsp; [NEG go]&nbsp; Here we’re saying the idea of not going is obligatory. So NEG falls within the scope of MUST. In other words, it’s obligatory that you not go: you must not go.<br /><br />In Na’vi, this was originally *zene ke kivä, but since this construction occurs so frequently (people are always saying, “You must not do this”!), zene and the immediately following ke have coalesced over time into zenke.<br /><br />As you’ve noted, though, the wider issue is, what happens with the other modals like tsun, new, and var?<br /> <br />Tsun<br /> <br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Po ke tsun yivom.<br />4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Po tsun ke yivom.<br /> <br />You’re right that we haven’t seen 4 yet. I have to admit that when I first looked at it, and also at your “Pefya tsun nga ke stivawm aylì’uti oeyä?” sentence, they seemed wrong. But the more I think about it, the more I feel that that structure should be OK. After all, if it weren’t, we wouldn’t have *zene ke kivä as the source of zenke kivä, right?<br /><br />The next question is, is there a semantic difference between 3 and 4? Yes, there is, as your examples show very clearly.<br /> <br />The final question is, would tsun ke in 4 coalesce into *tsunke? I think the answer here is no, since tsun ke occurs much less frequently than zene ke. (How often do people say, “I’m able not to do X”?)<br /> <br />New<br /> <br />5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Po ke new kivä.<br />6.&nbsp; &nbsp; Po new ke kivä.<br /> <br />As before, we should consider 6 OK grammatically. <br /> <br />The semantic difference between 5 and 6, though, isn’t as clear. Is there a distinction between “He doesn’t want to go” and “He wants not to go”? (I know the second sentence sounds awkward, but the structure is perfectly possible. If you google “wants not to,” you’ll find things like “What if Britain wants not to change?” and “She wants not to be herself.”) Do you see a difference in meaning between 5 and 6? I confess I tried to pin down a difference just now but wound up deleting what I had written, since I didn’t find it completely convincing.<br />I’d be interested in any thoughts you might have about this.<br /> <br />In any event, we should allow both 5 and 6 grammatically. And I doubt new ke would have developed into *newke.<br /> <br />Var<br /> <br />7.&nbsp; &nbsp; Po ke var yivom.<br />8.&nbsp; &nbsp; Po var ke yivom.<br /> <br />Again, both are grammatical. Here, I think, there’s more of a clear semantic distinction. In 7, she was eating, but she stopped: She didn’t continue to eat. In 8, she hasn’t been eating, and she’s kept it up: She continues not to eat. As before, I wouldn’t expect var ke to have developed into *varke.<br />[...]<br />Eywa ngahu,<br />ta Pawl<br />[/quote]
